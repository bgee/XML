	This year&rsquo;s list is comprised of 11 seniors, eight juniors, four sophomores and two freshmen. The student-athletes selected represent 17 NCAA DI universities and five athletic conferences. Alabama leads the way among universities with four athlete representatives, followed by Oklahoma and Tennessee with three apiece, Texas with two and Arizona State, Arkansas, California, Florida, Louisville, LSU, Michigan, Missouri, Notre Dame, Oregon, Penn State, South Florida and Washington each have one member.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>

    <title><![CDATA[Hofstra hires Niagara's Mihalich as 12th head coach in program history]]></title>
    <description><![CDATA[<div class="inline-left photo">
	<img src="/sites/default/files/images/Hofstra-Newcoach-mug.jpg" style="width: 100px; height: 150px;" />
	<div class="photo-caption">
		Mihalich</div>
</div>
<p>
	<strong>HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. --</strong> Joe Mihalich is leaving behind 15 successful seasons at Niagara to take over Hofstra&#39;s men&#39;s basketball program.</p>
<p>
	The 56-year-old was announced by the school as its 12th basketball coach on Wednesday.</p>
<p>
	Several media outlets, including Newsday and The Buffalo News, reported Mihalich&#39;s hiring Tuesday night.</p>
<p>
	Mihalich replaces Mo Cassara, who was fired March 22 following a 7-25 season. Four Pride players were arrested in November on burglary charges stemming from dormitory room break-ins.</p>
<p>
	Hofstra lands an established coach and respected recruiter in Mihalich, who played a big role in reviving the Purple Eagles&#39; proud basketball tradition. He finished his tenure at Niagara with a 265-203 record and five postseason berths, including two NCAA tournament appearances in 2005 and &#39;07.</p>
<p>
	Before Mihalich, the Purple Eagles had reached the NCAA tournament only once, in 1970, when the team was led by Calvin Murphy and coached by Frank Layden.</p>
<p>
	Niagara also earned three NIT berths, including this year, when the Purple Eagles (19-14) won their third Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference regular-season championship under Mihalich.</p>
<p>
	He&#39;s a three-time MAAC coach of the year, and won 20 or more games four times while experiencing only three losing seasons at Niagara.</p>
<p>
	Last week, he was selected the Skip Prosser Man of the Year, which has been award annually since 2008 to honor the nation&#39;s Division I men&#39;s basketball coach who exhibits strong moral character.</p>
<p>
	At Hofstra, he takes over a Colonial Athletic Association program that has stumbled on and off the court over the past two seasons. The Pride have gone 17-47 in their past two years after a 21-12 finish in Cassara&#39;s first season in 2010-11.</p>
<p>
	Hofstra hasn&#39;t reached the NCAA tournament since consecutive appearances in 2000 and &#39;01. The Pride also earned three consecutive NIT berths from 2005-07.</p>
<p>
	The Pride&#39;s season didn&#39;t get off to a good start last year after Taran Buie and Jamal Coombs-McDaniel were suspended by Cassara for two preseason events and two regular-season games for violating team rules.</p>
<p>
	In late November, sophomore Shaquille Stokes and freshmen Kentrell Washington, Jimmy Hall and Dallas Anglin were charged in six burglaries that occurred Oct. 4-5.</p>

<p>
	The historical significance was not lost on Auriemma.</p>
<p>
	&quot;The fact I tied Pat Summitt&#39;s record - that puts you in a category with the greatest women&#39;s basketball coach who ever lived,&quot; Auriemma said.</p>
<p>
	Summitt, who retired after last season, is the all-time winningest coach in NCAA basketball -- men&#39;s or women&#39;s and won her eighth title in 2008.</p>
<p>
	&quot;The only person I would compare myself to is Pat Summitt &hellip; and to be there in that spot with her means a lot to me,&quot; Auriemma said.</p>
<p>
	In 28 seasons as UConn&#39;s head coach, Auriemma has posted a 91-17 record in NCAA Tournament play, and been in serious contention to win national titles every year since winning his first one in 1995.</p>
<p>
	&quot;I&#39;m really, really proud of that,&quot; Auriemma said. &quot;Because I know how hard it was to do it. And with each year that goes by and teams get knocked out and teams that everybody thinks are national championship teams or programs that should be in the Final Four and are not, with each year that that happens, I feel even better about what we&#39;ve done. Because I know more than anybody else, and so does my staff, just how incredibly difficult it is to do what we&#39;ve done.&quot;</p>
<p>
	Auriemma holds the record for most consecutive Women&#39;s Final Four appearances with six and has the best NCAA winning percentage of any coach in history (.842).</p>
<p>
	But even Auriemma never dreamt his program could win eight championships.</p>
<p>
	&quot;When we started and got to our first Final Four - here in New Orleans - we almost acted like we didn&#39;t belong,&quot; Auriemma said. &quot;The other three teams were Stanford, Virginia and Tennessee. When we didn&#39;t win, we thought, &#39;what if we never go back? What if we&#39;re one and done?&#39; There are other teams that have made it to the Final Four and never been back.</p>
<p>
	&quot;Then, when we won our first national championship in 1995, I thought lots of people have won one. What if we don&#39;t ever win again? I&#39;m always looking into the future and thinking, &#39;is this it? Are we going to be one of those programs? To back now and see how far we&#39;ve come in the last 18 years, never in our wildest dreams did we think it was possible.&quot;</p>
<p>
	This season, with three losses to Notre Dame and another to Baylor, the Huskies were having a &quot;sub-par&quot; season for the program. After UConn lost against the Irish in the Big East Championship Game, he sat with the team in the locker room and told them he was going to show them how to win a national championship. And, he did.</p>
<p>
	&quot;Sure enough, we&#39;re sitting right here,&quot; senior guard Kelly Faris said. &quot;There are times I don&#39;t know how he does what he does but he&#39;s pretty darn good at his good and figures out a way to get it done. I&#39;m happy to have him on my side.&quot;</p>
<p>
	Incredibly, the Huskies are 8-0 in NCAA title games -- a feat no other program had accomplished.</p>
<p>
	&quot;Eight for eight?&quot; Auriemma said. &quot;Man, oh, man &hellip; I&#39;ve been in the Final Four a couple times when we&#39;ve lost where mentally we weren&#39;t right. But we&#39;ve never been in a championship game where mentally we weren&#39;t right. All eight times that we&#39;ve won a national championship, I felt like my team was mentally ready to win a championship. And I think that&#39;s something that I&#39;m really proud of; that we don&#39;t show up in championship games not ready to play mentally or physically.&quot;</p>
<p>
	<strong>Taking notes</strong></p>
<p>
	<strong>&bull; </strong>The 33-point margin of victory was the largest in a championship game, obliterating the previous mark of 23 points by Tennessee&rsquo;s 1987 championship squad against Louisiana Tech (67-44.)</p>
<p>
	&bull; UConn&rsquo;s win against Louisville marks just the second time that a team has defeated two teams from its conference in the Final Four to claim the national title (Maryland, 2006.)</p>
<p>
	&bull; Breanna Stewart became just the fourth freshman and first since 1987 to be named Most Outstanding Player of the Women&rsquo;s Final Four. The other three were Cheryl Miller (USC, 1983); Clarissa Davis (Texas, 1986); and Tonya Edwards (Tennessee, 1987). Stewart becomes the first freshman since Maryland&rsquo;s Kristi Toliver in 2006, to be made to the Women&rsquo;s Final Four all-tournament team.</p>]]></description>

<p>
	Louisville&rsquo;s deadly 3-point threat had gotten them through some fierce, improbable matchups during the NCAA tournament, including defeats of No. 1 seed Baylor and No. 2 seeds Tennessee and California. Prior to the title game, the team had averaged nearly 50-percent from beyond the arc in the tournament.</p>
<p>
	Against Connecticut though, it was quite a different story. The Cards couldn&rsquo;t connect from 3-point range, going 5-for-23 to finish at 22-percent in the loss. Compare that to the Huskies&rsquo; 53-percent field-goal shooting and 50-percent from behind the arc, and Louisville had no shot -- literally.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;They just made big shot after big shot,&rdquo; Louisville head coach Jeff Walz said. &ldquo;Starting the second half, we come out, we score. Then Faris hits a 3. We come back down the floor and score again. Faris hits another 3. &hellip; Unfortunately we were never able to get it to where a shot actually started to matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	There&rsquo;s no question that it was an amazing run for the Cardinals, the most thrilling of this year&rsquo;s tournament. Not many teams could&rsquo;ve paved the way through the bracket that Louisville did, perhaps not even UConn.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I&rsquo;m proud of every single one of our players,&rdquo; Walz said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s without a doubt going to go down as one of the greatest runs in women&rsquo;s basketball.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	And the good news is, Walz is bringing back all of his starters and the majority of his bench, along with a group that has a national championship game under their belts. Not to mention the hopeful return of Asia Taylor, Tia Gibbs and Shawnta&rsquo; Dyer, all of which were injured this season.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Everybody&rsquo;s coming back, and so that&rsquo;s bad for everybody else because we did make this run at the end of the tournament, and it&rsquo;s just going to continue into next season and we&rsquo;re just going to get better and grow as a team and learn from this and hopefully be back next year,&rdquo; junior guard Shoni Schimmel said.</p>
<p>
	It&rsquo;d be easy to pat his team on the back and tell his players they should be proud of making it this far, of being the first No. 5 seed to be playing in the title game. But Jeff Walz doesn&rsquo;t want his team to be satisfied with just making it this far. There&rsquo;s some unfinished business at hand, and he wants them to feel the hunger to get back here next season and then take it one step further.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;We&rsquo;re honored to have the opportunity to play for the national championship, but we&rsquo;re not satisfied with the results,&rdquo; Walz said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to continue to get back to work and hopefully be able to be the ones that are out there celebrating.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	<strong>Taking Notes</strong></p>
<p>
	&bull; Louisville ends its season at 29-9 overall, reaching the national title game for the second time in school history.<br />
	&bull; The 29 wins is the second-most in school history, behind the 35 victories posted during the 2008-09 campaign.<br />
	&bull; Louisville is the lowest seed in history to reach the championship game.<br />
	&bull; Senior forward Monique Reid played in her 141st career game and is Louisville&rsquo;s all-time leader in games played.<br />
	&bull; The 33-point loss was Louisville&rsquo;s largest loss of the season.<br />
	&bull; UConn&rsquo;s 13 3-pointers made were the most given up by the Cardinals this season.<br />

</div>
<div>
	<p>
		<strong>CLEVELAND, Miss. -- </strong>Back-to-back RBI doubles by Tyler Cameron and Jackson McCurdy in the top of the eighth inning broke a 4-4 tie and helped propel No. 25 Southern Arkansas past No. 1 Delta State 6-5 on Tuesday evening at Ferriss Field.</p>
</div>
<p>
	The Muleriders (29-12) grabbed an early 1-0 lead in the top of the second inning when William Townsend singled to right field to score Cameron. That lead did not stand for long, however, as the Statesmen (27-5-1) scored an unearned run in the bottom of the frame to knot the game at one.</p>
<p>
	An inning later, the Statesmen took the lead on a RBI single to right field by Sam Kidd. On the next pitch, SAU starter Timothy Buchanan induced an inning-ending double play. Prior to that twin killing, the Muleriders&#39; defense had turned a double play in each of the first two innings.</p>
<p>
	In the next half inning, the Muleriders regained the lead as they scored a pair of runs on a two-RBI single off the bat of Jason Dahl. The go-ahead hit by Dahl scored Ryan Dardenne and Tyler Cameron, who both walked on four consecutive pitches to lead off the inning.</p>
<p>
	After holding the Statesmen off the board in the fourth, the Muleriders extended their lead out to two-runs as Chris Quinn led off the fifth inning with a solo homerun out to left field. The Statesmen answered back with a leadoff homer of their own in the sixth inning when Michael Vinson homered to right field to cut the Mulerider lead to 4-3.</p>
<p>
	The Vinson homerun chased Buchanan from the start, prompting James Baune to come on for his first relief appearance of the year. After allowing a one-out single, Baune induced the Statesmen into their fourth double play of the game as he got out of the inning with the lead intact.</p>
<p>
	An inning later, however, the Statesmen scored an unearned run off of Baune to knot the game up at four.</p>
<p>
	In the Muleriders&#39; next at-bats in the eighth, Dardenne led off with a well-placed a single into left-centerfield. On the next pitch, Cameron chased Dardenne home as he laced the ball past the drawn-in third baseman for a run-scoring double. In the next at-bat, McCurdy traded places with Cameron as he shot the ball the other way down the right field line.</p>
<p>
	Now leading by a pair of runs, the Muleriders turned to the bullpen once more. This time, Blake Sullivan was called upon to protect the lead and the freshman left-hander did just that by using five pitches to toss a perfect bottom of the eighth inning.</p>
<p>
	The Muleriders were unable to build on their lead in the top of the ninth inning, but in the bottom of the frame, the ball was turned over to Justin Thomas to close it out. Thomas, who was looking to tie his own single-season saves record, got into a deep jam as the first two batters reached base.</p>
<p>
	A sacrifice bunt in the next at-bat gave Thomas an out, but it also moved the base runners up 90-feet, and put the tying run in scoring position at second base. A batter later, the Statesmen pulled to within a run as Thomas got Kidd to groundout to David Harris at shortstop for the second out of the inning. Two pitches later, Thomas nailed down his record-tying 11th save of the season as he got Tyler Aldridge to groundout to Brady Capshaw at third base.</p>]]></description>

<p>
	<strong>CORVALLIS, Ore. -- </strong>Aaron Payne had a two-RBI triple in the top of the ninth inning to break a 3-3 tie and lead No. 9 Oregon to a 6-3 win against No. 7 Oregon State in a non-conference game on Tuesday at Goss Stadium.</p>
<p>
	Payne pulled a 1-2 pitch into the right field corner scoring J.J. Altobelli from second and Brett Thomas from first to give the Ducks a 5-3 lead. Ryon Healy added a sacrifice fly to score Payne to give Oregon (24-8) a three-run lead.</p>
<p>
	Jimmie Sherfy got Oregon State (25-6) in order in the ninth striking out the first two batters he faced before ending the game on a fly ball to right field. Sherfy picked up his ninth save of the season.</p>
<p>
	Freshman Garrett Cleavinger picked up his first career-win pitching a scoreless eighth inning. Four Ducks&rsquo; relievers combined to hold OSU scoreless over the final five innings of the game. Darrell Hunter entered the game with the score tied to begin the fifth and threw two scoreless innings. Christian Jones struck out two Beavers in scoreless seventh inning.</p>
<p>
	Payne went 2-for-3 with two RBI and two walks to lead the Ducks&rsquo; offense. Tyler Baumgartner was 2-for-4 with a RBI.</p>
<p>
	Oregon State took a 1-0 lead in the bottom of the first when Oregon starter Jordan Spencer walked Jake Rodriguez with the bases loaded.</p>
<p>
	Oregon answered with two runs in the second without the benefit of a hit. The Ducks took advantage of two hit by pitches and four wild pitches by starter Taylor Starr to get the runs. Connor Hofmann picked up a RBI to score the first run a fielder&rsquo;s choice sacrifice bunt scoring Scott Heineman. Josh Graham scored the second run on a wild pitch. Both Heineman and Graham reached base by being hit by pitches.</p>
<p>
	Baumgartner pushed the lead to 3-1 in the third with a RBI single over the shortstop&rsquo;s head to score Mitchell Tolman from second.</p>
<p>
	The Beavers tied it with two runs in the bottom of the fourth. Jared Casper drove in the first run with a RBI single to centerfield and advanced to second on an error by Hofmann. Casper scored the tying run on a Ryan Barnes sacrifice bunt.</p>
<p>
	Oregon returns to Pac-12 Conference play this weekend when they play a three-game series at Cal on Friday.</p>]]></description>

		<strong>CORTLAND, N.Y. --</strong> Ithaca split a pair of games in a doubleheader on Tuesday at SUNY Cortland (11-11) and each game ended in dramatic fashion. The Bombers won a 6-5 game in nine innings in the first contest, then dropped a 1-0 game, with the lone run coming in the bottom of the last inning of game two.</p>
</div>
<p>
	During the first game, the Bombers trailed 3-1 going to the last inning, but scored four runs in the top of the seventh to take the lead. Carianne D&#39;Alessandro delivered a two-run double to tie the score and the Bombers added runs on RBI hits by Jennifer Biondi and Sydney Folk. The Red Dragons tied the score with two runs in the bottom of the seventh.</p>
<p>
	Ithaca took the lead in the top of the ninth when Biondi ripped a line drive off of the third baseman&#39;s glove down the left field line to bring home Jenna Tambasco.</p>
<p>
	Laura Quicker earned the victory in the circle in relief of Ithaca starter Sam Bender. Quicker pitched the final two innings, allowing two hits with one strikeout and improved to 1-1 on the year. Bender scattered 14 hits through seven innings with one strikeout. Biondi was 3-for-4 with two RBIs in the game. Rachel Dell&#39;Orto and Tambasco each scored two runs.</p>
<p>
	A pitcher&#39;s duel in the second game saw the teams combine for just eight hits through seven innings. Cortland scored the decisive run in the bottom of the seventh after a leadoff double followed by a single later in the inning.</p>
<p>
	Julianne Vincent had two hits for Ithaca, Biondi had a double and Casey Gavin had a base hit for Ithaca. Allison Macari pitched well with three strikeouts and no walks in 6.1 innings.</p>]]></description>

		Tobias</div>
</div>
<p>
	<strong>TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- </strong>Sophomore Josh Tobias snapped a 3-3 tie with a sacrifice fly in the ninth inning to drive in freshman Harrison Bader with the decisive run as Florida (16-18) edged No. 6 Florida State (27-6) 4-3 in front of a crowd of 6,719 fans on Tuesday night at Dick Howser Stadium, the fifth-largest crowd in school history. It marked the second year in a row that the Gators had emerged victorious in Tallahassee.</p>
<p>
	Bader (2-for-4, three runs) had reached on a leadoff throwing error by sophomore third baseman Jose Brizuela, taken second on the play and gone to third on a failed pickoff attempt by junior Robby Coles (2-1). Tobias&rsquo; second sac fly of the year moved the Gators in front and junior Daniel Gibson (1-0) retired the Seminoles in order in the ninth to collect his first win of the season and help UF take the finale of the teams&rsquo; regular-season meetings after coming up short in the first two outings.</p>
<p>
	Florida State had seized a 1-0 lead in the first inning on a two-out RBI double by junior Marcus Davis. Making his first start since March 13, 2012, also against the Seminoles, sophomore left-hander Bobby Poyner started the frame with a strikeout of redshirt junior Brett Knief for his first K of the season. Freshman DJ Stewart (3-for-4, two runs) followed with a base-hit up the middle and Poyner caught redshirt junior Stephen McGee looking on the strikes for the second out. Davis roped his team-leading 13th double of the campaign into right center field to open the scoring.</p>
<p>
	The Gators knotted the score at 1-1 on a bases-loaded sacrifice fly by freshman Richie Martin in the third inning. Seminoles junior righty Peter Miller retired the first seven Gators of the contest before Bader and senior Cody Dent had back-to-back singles with one down. Sophomore Casey Turgeon worked a walk on a full count to load the bases and Martin&rsquo;s first collegiate sac fly into right field brought home Bader with the tying run. Dent was thrown out at third base as part of an attempted double steal to end the inning.</p>
<p>
	Although Stewart led off the home part of the third with a double to left field, Poyner stranded him there on a pair of grounders by McGee and Davis and a lineout by sophomore John Nogowski to redshirt sophomore third baseman Zack Powers.</p>
<p>
	Martin provided the Gators with a 2-1 lead in the fifth on a two-out double into right field. Miller had recorded the first two outs of the frame before issuing a free pass to Dent. Turgeon poked a single into right field and Martin&rsquo;s second two-bagger of the year into right field scored Dent and moved Turgeon to third. Miller worked out of further trouble by having sophomore Taylor Gushue ground out to first base.</p>
<p>
	Poyner matched his career-long stint of four innings, scattering four hits, yielding one run and totaling three strikeouts, before sophomore Justin Shafer took over on the mound. Shafer struck out Knief but then Stewart connected on a game-tying homer over the fence in right field to even the game at 2-2 on his fourth big fly of the season. Bader ended the stanza with a leaping grab at the left-field wall to rob Davis of a round-tripper.</p>
<p>
	Redshirt junior Gage Smith replaced Miller (5.0 IP, 5 H, 2 R) prior to the sixth and plunked Powers with one down before having senior Vickash Ramjit hit into a 5-4-3 double play. Junior Casey Smit had a pinch-hit single through the right side of the infield to open FSU&rsquo;s sixth and moved to second on a grounder by sophomore Giovanny Alfonzo that was the second out of the inning. Sophomore Ryan Harris was summoned from the bullpen for Shafer (1.2 IP, 2 H, 2 R) and uncorked a wild pitch that pushed Smith to third base. Freshman Jameis Winston (2-for-3) put the hosts on top, 3-2, with a double into right center but was thrown out at third base to complete the inning.</p>
<p>
	The Gators answered with the tying run in the seventh on a two-out passed ball that scored Bader. Bader had collected his second hit of the night with a single into right field and sophomore Billy Strode came in for Smith (1.1 IP, 1 H, 1 R) and had pinch hitter Tobias line out to center field. Bader moved into scoring position with his team-leading sixth stolen base and took third on a throwing error by McGee. The rookie scampered home on a passed ball to square the affair at 3-3.</p>
<p>
	Winston replaced Strode (0.2 IP) on the mound to begin the eighth and mishandled Martin&rsquo;s bunt for a fielding error to start the frame. After Gushue flew out to right field, Shafer singled into left field to move Martin to third base and went to second on the relay throw. The Seminoles elected to walk Powers intentionally to load the bases with one out and Coles kept the game tied by having Ramjit pop up to second base and sophomore Connor Mitchell ground out to first base.</p>
<p>
	In the bottom of the frame, McGee led off with a base-hit to center field, prompting a pitching change. Gibson came in for Harris (1.1 IP, 2 H) and had Davis fly out to left center. After issuing a walk to Smit, Gibson uncorked a wild pitch that advanced McGee to third base. With runners on the corners and one down, Gibson induced an inning-ending 4-6-3 double play by Brizuela.</p>
<p>
	Bader reached on a throwing error by Brizuela to begin the ninth and wound up on second base. A failed pickoff attempt by Coles enabled Bader to take third with none out and Tobias delivered a sacrifice fly into right field to give the Gators a 4-3 advantage. Florida State held an 8-7 advantage in hits but committed four errors, compared to zero for the Gators.</p>]]></description>

		Luke Armour scored three goals in the first 18 minutes and Tom Schreiber scored three goals and added an assist to lead No. 10 Princeton to a 13-8 win against Rutgers on Tuesday at Yurcak Field.</p>
</div>
<p>
	With the win, Princeton improved to 7-3 on the year. The Tigers also won the Meistrell Cup, given to the winner of the Princeton-Rutgers game, for the 24th time in 25 years. Princeton leads the all-time series 59-29-3.</p>
<p>
	Slowed by injuries, Armour had not stepped on the field in any of Princeton&#39;s first nine games this season, however just three minutes into the second quarter Armour had already scored three times.</p>
<p>
	The Tigers were without both Jack Strabo and Chris White, which forced some reshuffling of the shortstick defensive midfield line. Bobby Lucas, who had been playing offensive midfield, returned to defense, teaming with Hunter deButts and freshman Austin deButts, who had the most extensive playing time of his first season and responded with a very strong outing.</p>
<p>
	The Scarlet Knights came into the game having been outscored by only two goals for the season. In their first nine losses, four were by one goal, including two in overtime and three others by two.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Rutgers came back from being down 5-2 to tie it at five and six, but Princeton scored three goals in the final 2:23 of the first half to take control and lead 9-6 at intermission.</p>
<p>
	Princeton was up 8-6 and in possession when head coach Chris Bates called timeout with 14 seconds left in the first half. On the restart, the ball went up top to Schreiber, who ripped his third goal of the night to make it 9-6 with three seconds left. Rutgers got no closer in the second half.</p>
<p>
	Mike MacDonald and Jeff Froccaro both had four-point nights with two goals and two assists for the Tigers. Brendan McGrath had an assist for his first point of the year. Princeton goalkeeper Matt O&#39;Connor made 12 saves.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Face-offs were even at 12-for-24 for both teams. Princeton went 3-for-4 in extra man situations.</p>]]></description>

		<strong>GRANBURY, Texas --</strong> Jessica Pickwick led No. 4 Tarleton State with a first-place finish at 2-over-par 146, while guiding the TexAnns (307-301-608) to a first-place finish against No. 3 St. Edward&rsquo;s (312-302-614) at the Doc Housewright Invitational at Harbor Lakes Golf Club in Granbury on Tuesday.</p>
</div>
<p>
	The six-stroke victory gives Tarleton its second first-place win of the spring season and third of the year.</p>
<p>
	Just as she did in the opening round, Pickwick carded a final round 1-over-par 73 en route to a two-stroke win against SEU&rsquo;s Wallis Spears, who finished with a score of 4-over-par 148 to come in second-place individually.</p>
<p>
	Pickwick birdied the par-four third hole and went out in 35 over the first nine holes before closing out the final nine holes with another birdie on the par-four 13th hole, a pair of bogies and one double-bogey.</p>
<p>
	This was Pickwick&rsquo;s second individual tournament title of the 2012-13 season, but it was her best 36-hole score of the year as she bettered her score of 150 that she recorded three times. She has finished in the top-10 in all eight events she has participated in this year.</p>
<p>
	Isabell Jimenez-Perea carded a final round 4-over-par 76 to finish in a tie for third-place with a two-day score of 8-over-par 152. She ends the regular season with three tournament titles and seven top-10 finishes.</p>
<p>
	Jacqueline Lau (78-77-155) finished three strokes behind Jimenez-Perea to tie for 10th place overall, while Sharon Lau (81-75-156) bettered her first-day total by six strokes to finish in a tie for 12th. Sarah Fulfer (80-77-157) shot three strokes better in Tuesday&rsquo;s final round and rounded out Tarleton&rsquo;s team scoring in a tie for 15th.</p>
<p>
	Ashley Snyder (87-88-175) finished in a tie for 42nd while competing as an individual for the TexAnns.</p>
<p>
	Angelo State entered Tuesday&rsquo;s final round in fifth place, but the Rambelles carded a final-round 305 to finish in third place with a score of 48-over-par 624. A&amp;M-Commerce (314-311-625) finished fourth as a team and Western Washington (327-307-634) rounded out the top five.</p>
<p>
	Incarnate Word (317-322-639), Western New Mexico (326-318-644), East Central (336-330-666) and St. Mary&rsquo;s (Texas) (343-343-686) rounded out the tournament field.<br />
