    <title><![CDATA[Ranked matchups highlight the weekend]]></title>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>
	Big-time men&rsquo;s lacrosse will be showcased at the Big City Classic on Saturday when four of the nation&rsquo;s top-12 teams converge at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J., to conclude the regular season in front of an expected crowd of 25,000 fans.</p>
<p>
	Two Ivy League squads -- <strong>No. 6 Cornell</strong> and <strong>No. 12 Princeton</strong> -- will clash in the first contest at 4 p.m., while <strong>No. 2 Notre Dame</strong> and <strong>No. 9 Syracuse </strong>will follow at 6:30 p.m., in a battle for first place in the Big East. Both games will be televised live on ESPNU.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an honor to play in events like this,&rdquo; Notre Dame head coach<strong> Kevin Corrigan</strong> said. &ldquo;These are some of the showcase events of college lacrosse &ndash; great match-ups, great crowds, great venues and we love being a part of these events and give these experiences to our student-athletes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	The Konica Minolta Big City Classic is one of a handful of neutral site men&rsquo;s lacrosse events held in NFL stadiums that have popped up across the nation in recent years, but the New York City-area has embraced it like no other. The event, organized by Inside Lacrosse, has drawn at least 25,000 fans in each of the last three years, and holds the regular-season record for a lacrosse-only event.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I think 20 years ago if you would have proposed playing this game in Giants Stadium people would have thought you were crazy,&rdquo; Corrigan said. &ldquo;Now, these events have become part of our regular season. I think it is really cool. It&rsquo;s a win-win for everybody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	The Irish played in last year&rsquo;s Big City Classic, handily defeating <strong>St. John&rsquo;s</strong>, but this year&rsquo;s version has a lot more on the line. Notre Dame and Syracuse, along with <strong>Villanova</strong>, are tied for first place in the Big East standings. With a victory, the Irish can claim their final Big East Conference regular season title and the top seed in the league tournament.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;It couldn&rsquo;t have worked out much better for Inside Lacrosse I guess,&rdquo; Corrigan said.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good confluence of events.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;It is a huge game,&rdquo; Syracuse head coach<strong> John Desko</strong> said.&nbsp; &ldquo;It has some playoff meaning to it. For either team, it&rsquo;s going to be a big win. For us to go down to play in MetLife is big, but the game itself is big no matter where it is. We can easily end up seeing each other a week later (in the Big East tournament).&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	The Notre Dame-Syracuse game will feature one of the nation&rsquo;s top offenses against one of the top defenses. The Irish rank eighth in the nation in scoring defense, giving up just 7.92 goals per game, while the Orange is scoring 12.31 goals per game, which also ranks eighth nationally.</p>
<p>
	Both teams have also been battle-tested in a season that has shown incredible parity in the sport. Syracuse has played in eight one-goal games, including all three of the Orange&rsquo;s losses. The Irish have won four of their five one-goal contests, including all three overtime affairs this season.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;That&rsquo;s college lacrosse right now,&rdquo; Corrigan said. &ldquo;There are a lot of good teams out there and at this point you better come to play. When you talk about the growth of the game, it&rsquo;s not so much the number of the programs but the depth and quality of the programs in Division I is really where the startling growth has occurred. You&rsquo;re just seeing so many teams that can beat each other on any given day. From a fan&rsquo;s perspective, it makes for an exciting season. From a coach&rsquo;s perspective, it can be a little bit nerve-wracking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>
	&bull;&nbsp;College baseball fans will be zoning in on Raleigh, N.C., when <strong>No. 1 North Carolina</strong> visits <strong>No. 13 NC State</strong> for a three-game Atlantic Coast Conference series starting Friday at 6:30 p.m. If you don&rsquo;t have a ticket to one of the three sold-out games, you can stream them all live on ESPN3.com.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	North Carolina has suffered just three losses this season, including Tuesday&rsquo;s 9-8 setback to <strong>No. 21 UNC Wilmington</strong>, which snapped the Tar Heels&rsquo; 14-game winning streak. They bounced back with a victory against <strong>Charlotte</strong> on Wednesday, becoming the seventh-fastest team to reach 40 wins in NCAA history. Both teams are on top of the standings in their respective ACC divisions. Meanwhile, NC State is riding the nation&rsquo;s longest winning streak of 15 games after edging <strong>Davidson</strong>&nbsp;4-3 on Tuesday.</p>
<p>
	The Tar Heels entered the week ranked second in the nation with a 2.13 ERA, plus they are the top scoring team in Division I, averaging 8.9 runs per game. NC State is sparked by sophomore <strong>Trea Turner</strong>, who is batting .437 with a nation-best 1.44 runs scored per game, and sophomore pitcher <strong>Carlos Rodon</strong>, who paces the nation with 14.17 strikeouts per nine innings.</p>
<p>
	&bull;&nbsp;The top-two softball teams in the Southeastern Conference Western Division will clash when <strong>No. 12 LSU</strong> hosts <strong>No. 4 Alabama</strong> in a battle for first place in league play. The three-game series begins Thursday with a nationally-televised contest on ESPN2 at 8 p.m. The Tigers enter the weekend with a 2.05 ERA, behind senior <strong>Rachele Fico</strong>, who is allowing just 5.0 hits per game. The Tide has an almost identical ERA (2.09), but is batting an impressive .336, and scoring 7.3 runs per game, which ranks fifth nationally. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
	&bull;&nbsp;The <strong>No. 1 BYU men&rsquo;s volleyball team </strong>will host the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation Tournament beginning Thursday, and will take on <strong>No. 4 UCLA</strong> in semifinal action at 10 p.m. The Bruins are the last team to beat the Cougars, sweeping them and snapping BYU&rsquo;s 12-match winning streak on April 6. BYU is the top-seeded team in the tournament after claiming its first regular season title since 2004. UCLA has won 10 of its last 11 matches entering the weekend.</p>
<p>
	&bull;&nbsp;After losing four consecutive Pac-12 series to begin league play, the&nbsp;<strong>No. 16 UCLA</strong>&nbsp;<strong>softball squad </strong>has taken the last two weekends against league foes <strong>California</strong> and <strong>Arizona</strong> as the Bruins try to improve their 7-11 conference record. The Bruins will face another challenge this weekend as they host <strong>No. 6 Oregon</strong>, which currently is holding on to first place in the league standings. The Ducks will be tough to beat &ndash; they rank in the top-five nationally in both batting average (.346) and ERA (1.37), but UCLA fields one of the top defenses in the nation (.980 fielding), so it should be another great Pac-12 battle.</p>

<div>
	<p>
		&bull;&nbsp;The top-two Division I women&rsquo;s lacrosse teams could possibly face each other in the Atlantic Coast Conference Championship game on Sunday in Chapel Hill, N.C. Undefeated <strong>No. 1 Maryland</strong>, the four-time defending league champions, will face the winner of <strong>Virginia-Duke</strong> on Friday after earning a bye to the semifinals. <strong>North Carolina</strong> has won 13 of its last 14 games with the only setback being a one-goal loss at Maryland on April 6. The Tar Heels, who also received a bye to the semifinals, will take on the winner of <strong>Virginia Tech-Boston College</strong> on Friday. If the two teams meet in the championship game on Sunday, it will be the fourth consecutive year they will both advance to the final. Each game of the ACC tournament can be viewed on ESPN3.com.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<p>
	&bull;&nbsp;The <strong>James Madison softball team</strong> is on fire, riding a nine-game winning streak into a weekend series at defending Colonial Athletic Association champion <strong>Hofstra</strong>. JMU is 15-0 in CAA play, but the Pride sits in second place with a 12-2 mark, and will be looking to shake up the standings. Hofstra is led by senior pitcher <strong>Olivia Galati</strong>, who became the program&rsquo;s first First Team All-American last year after leading the nation with a 0.95 ERA and 17 shutouts. Galati continues to make a bid to win her fourth consecutive CAA Pitcher of the Year award with a 27-10 record, 1.57 ERA and 13 shutouts this season. She needs just 10 strikeouts to notch her third career 300-strikeout season. However, JMU&rsquo;s pitching is turning some heads as well. The Dukes rank ninth nationally with a 1.66 ERA, led by sophomore <strong>Heather Kiefer&rsquo;s</strong> sterling 0.99 ERA, which is the second-best in Division I.</p>
<p>
	&bull;&nbsp;The<strong> Cal State Monterey Bay baseball team</strong> cracked the NCBWA Division II Poll at No. 15 this week after sweeping <strong>Cal Poly Pomona</strong> to secure the program&rsquo;s first 30-win season. The Otters are looking to clinch their first postseason berth in the California Collegiate Athletic Association tournament when they play a four-game series against <strong>Cal State Stanislaus</strong> beginning Friday. They currently are in third place in the league standings. Junior outfielder <strong>Mark Hurley</strong> paces the Otters with a .358 batting average after hitting .529 last week and earning CCAA Player of the Week honors on Monday.<span style="font-size: 0.8em; line-height: 20px;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
	&bull;&nbsp;The <strong>No. 7 Trinity (Texas) baseball team</strong> concluded the regular season on a nine-game winning streak after topping <strong>Hardin-Simmons</strong>&nbsp;3-1 in non-conference action on Monday. Now, the Tigers will head to the Southern Collegiate Athletic Conference tournament on Friday to play <strong>University of Dallas</strong>. The Tigers finished tied with <strong>Centenary</strong> with a 15-5 record in league play, but are seeded second. Trinity will be seeking its first SCAC Championship since 2011. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
	&bull;&nbsp;<strong>Mercyhurst</strong>, the No. 1-ranked Division II men&rsquo;s lacrosse team, finishes off the season with a key contest as the Lakers head to <strong>No. 7 Seton Hill </strong>for a meeting between the two remaining unbeaten Eastern College Athletic Conference teams on Saturday. The winner will claim the inaugural ECAC regular season title and earn the right to host the ECAC tournament on May 3-5. Mercyhurst is 13-0 this season and has won 31 consecutive regular season contests dating back to 2011. Seton Hill has won 11 consecutive games entering the contest.&nbsp; The Griffins&rsquo; lone loss was by one-goal to NYIT in the second game of the season.</p>
<p>
	<img alt="" src="/sites/default/files/images/2011/Something_To_Talk_About.jpg" style="width: 630px; height: 50px; float: left;" /> &bull;&nbsp;The <strong>California men&rsquo;s golf team</strong> has won a school-record nine tournaments in 2012-13 as the No. 1 Golden Bears start postseason play on Monday at the Pac-12 championship hosted by <strong>UCLA</strong> at the Los Angeles Country Club North Course. The Bears will not only be vying for their second consecutive league championship (they won their first in 2012), but will also try to match the unofficial NCAA record of 10 tournament victories in a season set by the 1985-86 <strong>Oklahoma State</strong> team. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
	&bull; During the last few years, numerous college athletes have registered to be potential bone marrow donors through the National Bone Marrow Donor Program&rsquo;s Be the Match, and a few have been matched up with patients who are suffering from life-threatening blood cancers. One of the latest to find out he was a match was <strong>New Hampshire senior shot putter Cameron Lyle</strong>, who was a 100 percent match for a 28-year-old male suffering from acute lymphoblastic leukemia.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Later this month, Lyle will undergo the donation procedure, and not be able to lift more than 20 pounds for a few weeks.&nbsp;Because of the recovery time, Lyle will miss the rest of the track season, abruptly ending his athletic career, but he did not even blink at the decision to choose to save a life. &nbsp;<a class="leave-site-blue" href="http://unhwildcats.com/sports/mtrack/2012-13/releases/20130422s109kb" target="_blank">Read More</a></p>
<p>
	&bull;&nbsp;NCAA student-athletes all across the nation are involved in their communities and trying to make the world a better place, and <strong>San Francisco senior pitcher Bob Mott</strong> one of the leaders on that front. It was Mott&rsquo;s experience traveling in Africa that has driven him to help combat malaria and raise funds for nets to protect impoverished families against the disease.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	&quot;Growing up I wanted to make a ton of money and have a great job, and going to Africa really opened my eyes to the world,&rdquo; Mott said. &ldquo;I realized there were more important things to do and it made me want to help others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	With Mott&rsquo;s influence, the USF baseball program began sponsoring Strike Out Malaria, which raises monies for each strikeout registered by a Dons&rsquo; pitcher.&nbsp; Mott was a featured speaker at the World Malaria Day symposium held last year in the Bay Area and will travel to Uganda this summer with teammate <strong>Jason Mahood </strong>to coach youth baseball and help combat malaria. &nbsp;<a class="leave-site-blue" href="http://www.usfdons.com/news/2013/4/17/BB_0417135258.aspx?path=baseball" target="_blank">Read More</a></p>

    <title><![CDATA[LSU, North Carolina thriving in college baseball's new era of less power]]></title>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>
	It&#39;s been three years since college baseball zapped the power from its metal bats, causing the once ubiquitous slugfests to largely disappear.</p>
<p>
	Nobody has adjusted better than North Carolina and LSU.</p>
<p>
	Home runs are down more than 50 percent and scoring has plummeted since the NCAA put strict new guidelines on the sport&#39;s bats, causing them to behave much more like their wood counterparts at the professional level.</p>
<table class="inline-left" style="width: 250px;">

<p>
	So teams have had to find other ways to win.</p>
<p>
	&#39;&#39;There&#39;s a secret -- it&#39;s called balance and versatility,&#39;&#39; LSU coach Paul Mainieri said. &#39;&#39;The days of swinging for the fences and mashing 100-plus homers in a season are over. It helps to have a few guys who can hit the ball out of the park, but you&#39;ve got to have guys who can handle the bat and run. You&#39;ve got to have righties and lefties.&#39;&#39;</p>
<p>
	&#39;&#39;And of course, you&#39;ve got to pitch and play defense.&#39;&#39;</p>
<p>
	North Carolina (40-3) and LSU (38-4) are the class of college baseball so far this season. The Tar Heels just finished a 14-game winning streak and the Tigers are off to their best start in the program&#39;s storied history -- which includes six national titles.</p>
<p>
	The programs with the gaudy win-loss totals are among a handful of top contenders for the national title. The last time a college baseball national champion finished with less than 10 losses was in 1995, when Cal State Fullerton won the title with a 57-9 record.</p>
<p>
	North Carolina coach Mike Fox -- who is in his 15th season -- has the program off to an 18-2 start in the Atlantic Coast Conference. The Tar Heels ripped off a 14-game winning streak before a 9-8 loss to UNC Wilmington on Tuesday.</p>
<p>
	&#39;&#39;We&#39;re playing some good baseball these days and I&#39;d like to keep it that way,&#39;&#39; Fox said.</p>
<p>
	Both LSU and North Carolina have balanced rosters that include loads of pitching and defense and just enough power in the lineup to blast a few big hits that can put games out of reach.</p>
<p>
	&#39;&#39;We probably don&#39;t have the best offense in the country or the best pitching,&#39;&#39; Mainieri said. &#39;&#39;But we do play some great defense and when you put everything together, we&#39;ve got something special.&#39;&#39;</p>
<p>
	LSU&#39;s been dominant in arguably the most difficult league in college baseball -- the Southeastern Conference. The Tigers have a 15-3 league record and are one of six SEC teams ranked in Baseball America&#39;s top 25.</p>
<p>
	The hot SEC start is even more impressive considering they&#39;ve played 12 of their 18 games on the road.</p>

<p>
	It&#39;s a team with basically no weaknesses. Aaron Nola (7-0, 2.15 ERA) and Ryan Eades (7-1, 2.56) headline the rotation while closer Chris Cotton has eight saves and is one of five regularly-used relievers with an ERA under 2.00.</p>
<p>
	Mason Katz is hitting .397 with 13 homers and 60 RBIs while freshman Alex Bregman is batting .414 and five homers and adding terrific defense at shortstop.</p>
<p>
	&#39;&#39;When you have so many good hitters in the lineup, you&#39;ve got to pitch to somebody,&#39;&#39; Katz said. &#39;&#39;There are so many guys getting on base, that when you do hit a homer, you know it&#39;s probably going to drive in a few guys, too.&#39;&#39;</p>
<p>
	North Carolina has won nine straight games in the ACC, but will be challenged over the next three weeks with games against fellow conference powers North Carolina State, Georgia Tech and Virginia.</p>
<p>
	The Tar Heels like their chances with a pitching staff that includes Kent Emanuel (8-1, 1.82) and Trent Thornton (8-1, 0.88) and an experienced offense that&#39;s hitting a combined .317 and is among the ACC&#39;s leaders in almost every category.</p>
<p>
	&#39;&#39;I think our team has got a little bit of everything -- talent and personality,&#39;&#39; Emanuel said. &#39;&#39;It&#39;s a group that finds a way to win the tough games. The difference has really been our offensive production. It&#39;s so consistent it takes a lot of pressure off the pitchers.&#39;&#39;</p>
<p>
	Neither LSU or UNC is getting too excited about their impressive records.</p>
<p>
	Mainieri pointed out that his Tigers started out 32-6 in 2010, but a cold streak in May nearly kept the program out of the NCAA tournament.</p>
<p>
	&#39;&#39;The difference between a great team and an average team isn&#39;t as big as most people think,&#39;&#39; Mainieri said. &#39;&#39;We&#39;re flattered with all the attention so far this season, but they don&#39;t hand out any trophies in April.&#39;&#39;</p>]]></description>

    <title><![CDATA[Clicking on all cylinders]]></title>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>
	Brittany Fowler can pinpoint the exact moment South Alabama&rsquo;s softball program took a turn in the right direction.</p>
<p>
	On May 13, 2010, the Jaguars had just lost Sun Belt Conference tournament games on consecutive days to finish the season 21-24.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Coach [Becky Clark] had a meeting with us all who were returning the day after we lost,&rdquo; said Fowler, USA&rsquo;s senior shortstop who has essentially rewritten the program record book. &ldquo;We still all remember the speech. She said, &lsquo;We are going to change this program. We are going to become a powerhouse.&rsquo; We took it to heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Fast forward to 2013 and South Alabama is ranked 18th in the USA Today/NFCA poll and 16th in RPI.</p>
<p>
	Clark took a monumental leap of faith in the summer of 2005, accepting the head coaching job at a program that was nonexistent.</p>
<p>
	Her vision was to compete for championships, just as she had done in three years at nearby NAIA powerhouse Mobile.</p>
<p>
	Last season, the Jaguars won the Sun Belt Conference tournament and an NCAA Regional game against Georgia Tech. Two losses to No. 2 Alabama ended the season but left the return athletes knowing the bar had been raised.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;As the head coach, its your job to know what the big picture is and you try to help them get to that point so they know what it looks like,&rdquo; Clark said. &ldquo;I think once they&rsquo;ve been on that stage, everything kind of clicks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:16px;"><strong>Clicking right now.</strong></span><br />
	South Alabama (41-7) got a no-hitter from sophomore Farish Beard against Troy on Wednesday for its 12th win in a row. The 41 victories match last year&rsquo;s total with two regular-season games remaining, the Sun Belt Conference tournament and potentially the program&rsquo;s second NCAA Regional bid.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;It was great to get that [NCAA Regional] experience,&rdquo; said Fowler, the team&rsquo;s leadoff hitter. &ldquo;It really fueled us and made us want to get back. The feeling of playing in the postseason is something you can&rsquo;t describe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:16px;"><strong>Blue streak</strong></span><br />
	Coach Carol Hutchins&rsquo; Michigan softball team is unbelievably confident.</p>
<p>
	With 22 consecutive victories, the Wolverines have a reason to be confident.</p>
<p>
	Hutchins&rsquo; job is to keep her squad humble, not an easy task in this era of social media. She&rsquo;s always preached to win the next pitch and Michigan is winning a lot of next pitches.</p>
<table class="inline-left" style="width: 250px;">
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th scope="col">
				MICHIGAN&#39;S 22-GAME STREAK</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>
				&bull; Last loss: March 14 vs. Virginia Tech.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
				&bull; Outscored opponents 208-62.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
				&bull; Allowed one run or fewer in nine games.</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>
<p>
	&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve won games in all sorts of fashions,&rdquo; Hutchins said. &ldquo;Sometimes we&rsquo;ve been able to blow it out and sometimes we&rsquo;ve had to scratch and claw.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I guess we don&rsquo;t even talk about the streak. It is not our focus. I just want to win the game we&rsquo;re playing. The streak would be a result of that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Continuing to win through the weekend would provide a boost to Michigan&rsquo;s postseason resume.</p>
<p>
	The Wolverines travel to No. 20 Nebraska, 10th in RPI, for a three-game Big Ten series beginning Friday.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;It has implications for the conference, but more importantly for what we hope to accomplish in May,&rdquo; Hutchins said. &ldquo;I think our kids are up for the challenge. If we don&rsquo;t win three games, it&rsquo;s a good challenge for us to realize it&rsquo;s just a loss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:16px;"><strong>Top-25 battles</strong></span><br />
	While the Big Ten&rsquo;s only two ranked teams face each other, there are four additional matchups between ranked opponents, highlighted by top-10 foes in the Pac-12.</p>
<p>
	No. 10 California travels to No. 5 Arizona State and No. 6 Oregon prepares to face No. 16 UCLA.</p>
<p>
	Meanwhile, Southeastern Conference rivals Alabama and LSU square off in Baton Rouge. The Crimson Tide is ranked fourth and LSU is just outside the top 10 at No. 12. Also in the SEC, No. 11 Missouri travels to No. 19 Kentucky.</p>

	<strong>NORMAN, Okla. -- </strong>For the third time in its five-year history, and the first time since 2011, Oklahoma is ranked in the CRCA/U.S. Rowing Coaches&#39; Poll. The Sooners, who received votes in the first four polls to begin the season, are No. 20.</p>

	The only other time OU has been ranked was April 6 and April 13, 2011, when the Sooners were ranked 20th and 19th, respectively.</p>
<p>
	&quot;It&#39;s great to be recognized as one of the top 20 teams in the country,&quot; OU head coach Leeanne Crain said. &quot;This was one of our goals at the start of the season and I have to give praise to the entire team and coaching staff.</p>
<p>
	&quot;We&#39;ve had solid performances in all of our top boats this season, which shows the increased depth on our roster. It&#39;s nice to receive this recognition at this point in the season as we prepare for our conference championships and NCAAs.&quot;</p>
<p>
	In addition to being ranked No. 20 in the coaches&#39; poll, the Sooners are ranked in the top six of the South Regional rankings. As a team, Oklahoma is fourth behind Virginia, Louisville and Clemson. OU&#39;s highest ranking comes in the second Varsity 8, which is second behind Virginia. The Sooners&#39; varsity four is fifth, while the Varsity 8 is sixth.</p>
<p>
	No other Big 12 team is ranked or receiving votes in the coaches&#39; poll, and Tennessee is OU&#39;s only Conference USA rival receiving votes in the poll and ranked in the regional rankings.<br />

	EUGENE, Ore. -- Marcus Mariota simply isn&#39;t the type to bark orders, perhaps because of his mellow Hawaiian upbringing. But the sophomore quarterback for Oregon is vowing to be more vocal in his second season guiding the Ducks.</p>
<p>
	Last year at this time, Mariota was a redshirt freshman and an unknown commodity, having played only on the practice squad. He emerged during the spring game and eventually supplanted supposed starter Bryan Bennett in fall camp.</p>
<p>
	Throughout his first season, he mostly left the leadership to the seniors. He said it&#39;s his turn now.</p>
<div class="inline-left ckfg_group">
	<div class="ckfg_element">
		<div class="widget-left">
			<strong><span style="font-size: 24px;"><img alt="" src="/sites/default/files/images/OU_Marcus_Mariota.jpg" style="margin-left: 6px; margin-right: 6px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 6px; float: right; width: 60px; height: 90px; " />&ldquo;</span></strong><span style="font-size:20px;"><strong>There&#39;s situations when you can keep your head, there&#39;s situations where you need to say something</strong></span><strong><span style="font-size:20px;">.</span><span style="font-size:24px;">&rdquo;</span></strong><br />
			<strong>-- </strong><strong>Marcus Mariota</strong></div>
	</div>
</div>
<p>
	&quot;It&#39;s a little different. I think last year my mentality was to show what I could do,&quot; he said. &quot;This season I need to show I can get better.&quot;</p>
<p>
	Oregon&#39;s preparation for the coming season started earlier this month with spring practice. The annual spring game will be held Saturday at Autzen Stadium.</p>
<p>
	Oregon finished last season 12-1 with a 35-17 victory against No. 7 Kansas State in the Fiesta Bowl. It was the Ducks&#39; fourth consecutive trip to a BCS bowl game and second straight victory. Oregon ended up ranked No. 2 in the season&#39;s final AP Top 25.</p>
<p>
	Mariota set the team&#39;s single-season record with 38 touchdowns (32 passing, 5 rushing, 1 receiving), surpassing the previous mark of 36 held by Darron Thomas (2011) and Akili Smith (1998).</p>
<p>
	The first freshman named to the Pac-12&#39;s all-conference first team in 23 years, Mariota passed for 2,739 yards while completing a school-record 68.5 percent of his passes. He had 3,429 yards of total offense, second only to Smith&#39;s 3,947 in 1998.</p>
<p>
	Following the season, head coach Chip Kelly -- the no-nonsense architect of the Ducks&#39; speedy spread offense -- left Oregon to become head coach of the Philadelphia Eagles. The school promoted offensive coordinator Mark Helfrich.</p>
<p>
	Mariota said not much has changed under the amiable Helfrich, except -- jokingly -- there&#39;s &quot;less yelling.&quot; Kelly set the offensive foundation that the Ducks will continue to follow this season, with Mariota and running back De&#39;Anthony Thomas setting the pace.</p>

	Mariota is the product of St. Louis High School in Honolulu. He threw for 32 touchdowns and only five interceptions in leading the Crusaders to an 11-1 record and the state title as a senior. He was widely considered one of the state&#39;s best quarterback prospects since Tommy Chang.</p>
<p>
	He was on the practice squad in 2011 when the Ducks finished the season with a Rose Bowl victory against Wisconsin and Darron Thomas was at quarterback. Thomas declared early for the NFL draft and many assumed the starter&#39;s job would be passed on to Bennett, his backup.</p>
<p>
	But Mariota piqued the interest of fans during Oregon&#39;s annual spring game when he threw for 202 yards and a touchdown, and rushed for two additional scores. Because Kelly closed practices, it was uncertain until late last fall who would be Oregon&#39;s new starter.</p>
<p>
	Mariota won. Bennett transferred.</p>
<p>
	While Mariota wasn&#39;t the loudest player on the team, that didn&#39;t mean he wasn&#39;t assertive. Last season when there was some trash talking with the Northwest rival Huskies, he jumped right into the fray.</p>
<p>
	&quot;I&#39;m never the kind of guy that, if you disrespect me or disrespect my teammates, I&#39;m not going to just let that go,&quot; he said at the time. &quot;There&#39;s situations when you can keep your head, there&#39;s situations where you need to say something.&quot;</p>
<p>
	This season, Mariota accepts that most everyone will be looking toward him for leadership.</p>
<p>
	&quot;Especially with a lot of the veteran guys last season -- like Kenjon Barner and Michael Clay -- those guys left. Those were vocal guys,&quot; Mariota said. &quot;I&#39;m more of a low-key guy, so that&#39;s something I&#39;ve got to work on, especially at my position. They always ask the quarterback to be a little more vocal.&quot;</p>]]></description>

<div>
	<p>
		<strong>LEXINGTON, Ky. --</strong> Junior infielder Lauren Cumbess recorded her 21st multi-hit game of the season, including a walkoff single in the bottom of the seventh inning, while freshman pitcher Kelsey Nunley threw her 16th complete game of the year, allowing just one run with three strikeouts, en route to No. 19 Kentucky defeating in-state foe No. 7 Louisville 2-1 on Wednesday at John Cropp Stadium.</p>
</div>
<p>
	After Kentucky (35-14) scored the first run of the game in the bottom of the sixth inning on a wild pitch with the bases loaded and Louisville posted a leadoff home run in top of the seventh inning to tie the game, the Wildcats rallied in the bottom of the seventh to claim the win. Freshman outfielder Sylver Samuel started the rally with an infield single before back-to-back walks to sophomore catcher Griffin Joiner and freshman infielder Nikki Sagermann to load the bases. That brought up Cumbess, who hit a grounder deep in the hole on the left side of the infield, scoring Samuel and giving Kentucky the victory.</p>
<p>
	Cumbess led Kentucky offensively with a 2-for-4 night, earning the lone UK RBI. She has now hit safely in 14 of her last 15 games. For the season, Cumbess is hitting .363 (58-for-160) with 12 doubles, 11 home runs and 38 RBI. Senior Alice O&#39;Brien and junior Ginny Carroll also had multi-hit games with O&#39;Brien going 2-for-3 with a double, while Carroll was 2-for-2 with two singles. Freshman Christian Stokes and Samuel each had singles.</p>
<p>
	Nunley was solid in the circle for Kentucky, throwing a complete game, allowing one earned run on seven hits with three strikeouts. She is now 21-6 on the year with a 2.04 ERA, throwing 192.0 innings pitched with 146 strikeouts - which is seventh most in school history in a single season.</p>
<p>
	The win for Kentucky marked its sixth against a ranked foe this season and its third against a top-10 team this season. In the six-year tenure of head coach Rachel Lawson, the Wildcats have now defeated 37 top-25 teams and 22 top-15 teams. UK started the year with a win against No. 3 California while it has also defeated No. 3 Florida, No. 16 Washington, No. 20 Stanford and No. 25 North Carolina.</p>
<p>
	Louisville (42-7) started junior pitcher Rachel La Coq in the circle, throwing six strong innings and allowing one run on seven hits with one strikeout. La Coq was replaced by junior Caralisa Connell to start the seventh inning. Connell recorded an out to start the inning before allowing a single and back-to-back walks to load the bases. Louisville then brought La Coq back into the game to pitch when she gave up the game-winning hit to Cumbess. Connell picked up the loss moving to 25-3 on the year.</p>
<p>
	Offensively, Louisville was led by senior Alicja Wolny, who went 2-for-3 with a double, while junior Tanner Fowler went 1-for-3 with a solo home run. Senior outfielder Jordan Trimble went 2-for-4 in the game, while junior Katie Keller and senior Katelyn Mann each had singles.</p>
<p>
	Louisville still leads the all-time series against Kentucky 18-14, including a 9-7 edge in the series in games played in Lexington. Kentucky&#39;s win Wednesday snapped a four-game winning streak for the Cardinals in the series. UK and Louisville met three times last season with the Cardinals earning one-run wins in all three games. The final meeting was an NCAA regional elimination game in Louisville with the Cardinals posting a 3-2 victory. The Cardinals leads the all-time series in games played in Louisville 9-7. UK has played more games against Louisville than any other non-SEC team in school history.</p>
<p>
	This was the second meeting of the year between the two teams with Louisville earning a 5-1 victory at Ulmer Stadium in Louisville, Ky., back on April 3.</p>]]></description>

	<p>
		<strong>NOTRE DAME, Ind. --</strong> Fourth-ranked Northwestern used a 7-1 run covering both sides of halftime to overcome a feisty Notre Dame squad on Wednesday, downing the ninth-ranked Irish 10-8 at Arlotta Stadium in South Bend. Senior Erin Fitzgerald scored four points (three goals, one assist) and junior attacker Kat DeRonda contributed a career-best three goals to NU&#39;s 14th consecutive win against the Fighting Irish.</p>
</div>
<p>
	After the &#39;Cats built a five-goal advantage with 22:57 to play, the hosts did their best to rally with a 4-1 run in the second half. But sophomore goalkeeper Bridget Bianco -- who recorded seven first-half saves on her way to nine for the evening -- and the Northwestern defense kept the Irish off the scoreboard for the final 11 minutes of the game to secure the win.</p>
<p>
	Northwestern&#39;s willingness to do the dirty work defensively was reflected in a 24-17 advantage in ground balls for the evening, led by senior Ali Cassera&#39;s career-high-tying six as well as five from her classmate Taylor Thornton.</p>
<p>
	Fitzgerald put the Wildcats on the board offensively when she answered Notre Dame&#39;s first goal of the game with a score off a free position attempt and, after the NU defense forced a turnover in front of its own goal, Alyssa Leonard fired home a left-handed shot to give NU an early 2-1 lead.</p>
<p>
	The Irish put away two goals in a span of just 11 seconds to restore a 3-2 advantage at the 22:43 mark, but the Wildcats countered by running an efficient offensive set that ended with Fitzgerald feeding a cutting Kaleigh Craig for Craig&#39;s sixth score of the year. NU took a 4-3 lead soon after when Beatrice Conley wrapped the crease to score and Bianco kept Northwestern&#39;s lead intact with back-to-back saves on a fast-break opportunity for the Irish.</p>
<p>
	With eight minutes to go in the first, NU extended its lead when freshman Nancy Dunbar fed DeRonda in space for Northwestern&#39;s fifth goal of the evening.</p>
<p>
	With the Wildcats later protecting a one-goal lead, it appeared NU&#39;s final possession of the first half would end without the &#39;Cats getting a good look on cage, but the Irish defense was whistled<strong> </strong>with only one second left on the clock. Fitzgerald converted the ensuing 8-meter attempt to send Northwestern into the locker room with momentum and a 6-4 advantage.</p>
<p>
	Northwestern then came out strong in the second half, controlling possession and taking a 7-4 lead when Leonard wove her way through the defense and set up DeRonda on the doorstep. Barely a minute later, sophomore Jess Carroll used her speed to dodge straight down the middle of the Irish defense and beat Ellie Hilling in goal, notching her second goal of the season and forcing a timeout by Irish head coach Christine Halfpenny with 22:57 remaining.</p>
<p>
	The timeout paid dividends for Notre Dame, which was able to score once from the run of play and again off the free position arc to pull within three with 18:03 left. DeRonda briefly restored a four-goal NU edge with an 8-meter goal of her own, but Notre Dame notched two goals in a span of just 13 seconds to inch back to within 10-8 on the scoreboard and set up an exciting final 11 minutes.</p>
<p>
	After the teams traded turnovers, Northwestern worked several minutes off the clock before attempting a shot on an empty cage that went inches wide, returning possession to the Irish with 2:28 to play. Following a timeout, the &#39;Cats withstood a flurry in front of their own cage that saw Notre Dame ring a shot off the post and have another saved by Bianco before the Irish turned it over on a bad pass to seal the NU win.</p>]]></description>
