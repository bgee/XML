<p>
	<strong>HARTFORD, Conn.</strong> -- Midfielder Martha Griffin scored a game-high five goals to lead Trinity (Conn.) to a 19-5 victory against visiting Springfield at Sheppard Field. Reigning NCAA champion Trinity, ranked No. 1 in the nation, tied a program-record 18 wins in a row set in 2011, while improving to 10-0. Springfield fell to 7-6.</p>
<p>
	Trinity controlled play from the beginning, opening up a 6-0 led after 19:22 of play. Bantam senior attacker Hadley Duncan scored the game&#39;s first goal from senior attacker Haley Thompson 1:53 after the opening draw, and senior midfielder Megan Leonhard tallied three goals to highlight a 6-0 Trinity run to started the game.</p>
<p>
	Freshman midfielder Connie Nielson ended the Springfield scoring drought with back-to-back scores at 15:45 and 13:02 of the first half, respectively. Sophomore midfielder Michelle Dorsey scored the third consecutive Pride goal 28 seconds later to make the score 6-3.</p>
<p>
	The Bantams closed the first half with a 5-0 run that included consecutive goals by Griffin in the final three minutes before the break. After a goal by Dorsey from Nielson 30 second after halftime, junior attacker Shea Kusiak scored on a free position for the Bantams to ignite a 5-0 run that put the game out of reach. Attacker Molly Cox scored twice during the spurt.</p>
<p>
	Trinity sophomore midfielder Lindsay Mullaney was the fifth of five Bantam multiple-goal scorers with two, while Thompson and junior attacker Kathleen Timmons dished two assists apiece, and Leonhard had a game-high four draw controls and forced three turnovers. The Bantam defense of senior Mallory Hinman, senior Hillary McNamara, and juniors Midge Daniel and Lyndsey Shepard held Springfield to just eight shots and caused 11 turnovers, as Emily Mooney and senior Olivia Whitney did not make a save in 60 minutes in the Bantam goal. Junior backstop Anne Versprille had 11 stops for Springfield.</p>]]></description>

    <title><![CDATA[What they're facing]]></title>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>
	<strong>CANTON, Mich. --</strong> This will not be easy.</p>
<p>
	Coaches -- and thereby competitors, were given a look Wednesday at the lane graph for the national championship tournament, which will get under way Thursday morning at Super Bowl Lanes.</p>
<p>
	Think of the lane graph like a course book in golf. It gives the competitors a look at the hazards they&#39;ll face. Unlike golf however, those hazards aren&#39;t visible to the naked eye.</p>
<p>
	The lanes are dressed with oil -- sometimes called lane conditioner. When the ball hits the oil, it acts like a car tire trying to gain traction on ice. The more oil the ball comes in contact with, the more the ball will skid, or go straight. When the ball hits a dry area, it creates friction and the ball will hook -- or curve -- in the same direction as the rotation of the ball (usually left to right for lefties and from right to left for righties).</p>
<p>
	Ideally, competitors are looking for heavier oil in the front part of the lane and less in the back so the ball will save its energy to the end of the shot, therefore hitting the pins harder when it reaches them.</p>
<p>
	The oil pattern this week is 42 feet long -- that&#39;s a few feet longer than your normal &quot;house shot&quot; pattern -- with heavy oil across the lane in the first 10 feet and oil across the lane with the exception of just the first board on each side of the lane. There is more oil in the center of the lane, which give the players a bit of forgivness, but it&#39;s nowhere near the ratio of a common house condition.</p>
<p>
	In short, the players will have to be accurate and will have to be able to repeat shots -- under pressure -- in order to be successful.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>
	When you take a look at the list of teams vying for the 2013 NC Bowling Championship beginning Thursday at Super Bowl Lanes in Canton, Mich., two-time defending national champion Maryland-Eastern Shore is sure to grab your attention.</p>
<p>
	And it should. After all, the Hawks are two-time defending national champions and have won 10 tournaments this season. What&#39;s more, they haven&#39;t finished worse than second in any event they&#39;ve competed in this year.</p>
<p>
	&quot;We are honored to be the second overall selection,&quot; head coach Kristina Frahm said. &quot;I do feel, however that we have a top team and I think our experiences can help us make a serious run at winning another national championship.</p>

	</tbody>
</table></p>
<p>
	&quot;Obviously, we are looking for a three-peat.&quot;</p>
<p>
	Look a bit further at the team list and you&#39;ll notice that the field includes every school that has won the national championship since its inception in 2004.</p>
<p>
	Current NTCA No. 1 Nebraska won the first two championships in 2004 and &#39;05 and the Huskers hoisted the hardware again in 2009. The Huskers, like the Hawks, have participated in every national championship tournament. This season&#39;s Huskers, however, sport a bit of a different look than in years past. The team boasts just one senior, team leader Kristina Mickelson, who suffered a cracked elbow in a car accident in September and has seen limited action this season.</p>
<p>
	&quot;She&#39;s pretty gritty,&quot; head coach Bill Straub said. &quot;She&#39;s been wearing herself out with applications of Icy-Hot. She&#39;s had a restrictor on her elbow to kind of keep things tight so it&#39;s not too troublesome for her, but she just grits her teeth and plays along.</p>
<p>
	&quot;It&#39;s been a tough year for her, but not through lack of effort.&quot;</p>
<p>
	Mickelson&#39;s roommate, sophomore Liz Kuhlkin, has been more than a pleasant surprise this season, Straub said. She&#39;s earned spots on four different All-Tournament teams this season.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	&quot;Surprised might be too strong, but certainly well-pleased,&quot; Straub said of Kulikin. &quot;She&#39;s worked her tail off to try to help us out as best she can and she&#39;s just continuing to develop as a player and she&#39;s turned into quite an excellent one.&quot;</p>
<p>
	Central Missouri is ranked No. 2 in the country and enters the tournament as the No. 1 seed after snagging three tournament titles. The Jennies are led by senior Natalie Jimenez, who has averaged 209.60 this season while garnering a pair of Most Outstanding Player honors, including one at the McKendree Duals where she averaged more than 239.</p>
<p>
	Vanderbilt lost to UMES in the championship game in 2011. Last year in Cleveland, the Commodores lost to Fairleigh Dickinson in the last semifinal match. This year, Vandy will make its eighth trip to the championship tournament.</p>
<p>
	Head coach John Williamson says while it may seem differently, his team&#39;s consistency has not come easily.</p>
<p>
	&quot;Because we have had a nice run of success, it might be tempting for some fans to think this is easily attained but anyone closely following the regular season can attest that there are more quality teams than ever before and some very good teams were not chosen.&quot;</p>
<p>
	Just as Nebraska, the Commodores come to the championship with just one senior starter --&nbsp; Jessica Earnest, a three-time All-American who averaged 207 in team games and 212 in Baker contests.</p>
<p>
	Expect Vanderbilt to rely heavily on its underclassmen, including freshman Robyn Renslow, who often bowled in the anchor spot thanks to her 208.5 average Another freshman, lefty Amanda Fry, averaged 210 was the Most Outstanding Player at the Sam Houston State Track Kat Klash.</p>
<p>
	Fairleigh Dickinson, which lost to UMES in last year&#39;s final and won titles in 2006 and &#39;10, is back again as the eighth and final seed.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I am so proud of this team,&rdquo; head coach Mike LoPresti said. &ldquo;Now we have a new life and a second season. We went through a lot of transitions this year with a combination of a few veterans and a lot of new players. We&#39;re so happy to extend the season because we have made so many improvements, and now we get to put it all together on the nation&#39;s biggest stage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	One of those key veterans for the Knights is senior Danielle McEwen, last year&#39;s NTCA Division I Bowler of the Year. McEwen appears poised for more honors in Detroit. She averages 216.52 with a strike percentage of 54.65. In January, earned the individual championship at the USBC Team USA Trials for the second consecutive year. As a result, McEwan will be the sole US representative at the QubicaAMF World Cup and will be a member of Team USA during the calendar year.</p>
<p>
	For right now, however, McEwen is focused on enjoying this week.</p>
<p>
	&quot;It&#39;s not enough for me just to make it, especially in my senior year,&quot; she said. I want to... go into nationals with a different mindset and hopefully come out with a better outcome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	As for those defending champion Hawks, they are led by Colombian left-hander Anggie Ramirez. Recently named a finalist for the International Bowling Media Association College Bowler of the Year, Ramirez averaged nearly 213 during the regular season and earned MEAC Bowler of the Year, All-MEAC First-Team, MEAC Championship MVP and MEAC All-Tournament Team awards. She was also named the conference&#39;s Bowler of the Week six times.</p>
<p>
	&quot;It was always my dream since I was MEAC Rookie of the Year to be MEAC Player of the Year. Now that I won this and MVP of the tournament, I am so happy that my dream could come true,&quot; Ramirez said.</p>
<p>
	Competition begins with qualifying rounds on Thursday, April 11, in which each team bowls one five-person regular team game against each of the other seven teams participating in the championship for a total of seven games.</p>
<p>
	Bracket play begins Friday morning, as teams will be seeded based on Thursday&rsquo;s record during team qualifying. Teams will then compete in best-of-seven-games Baker matches in a double-elimination tournament.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	In the Baker format, each of the five team members, in order, bowls a complete frame until a complete (10-frame) game is bowled.&nbsp; A Baker match tied 3&frac12; games to 3&frac12; games after seven games will be decided by a tiebreaker using the Modified Baker format.</p>]]></description>

    <title><![CDATA[Hofstra hires Niagara's Mihalich as 12th head coach in program history]]></title>
    <description><![CDATA[<div class="inline-left photo">
	<img src="/sites/default/files/images/Hofstra-Newcoach-mug.jpg" style="width: 100px; height: 150px;" />
	<div class="photo-caption">
		Mihalich</div>
</div>
<p>
	<strong>HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. --</strong> Joe Mihalich is leaving behind 15 successful seasons at Niagara to take over Hofstra&#39;s men&#39;s basketball program.</p>
<p>
	The 56-year-old was announced by the school as its 12th basketball coach on Wednesday.</p>
<p>
	Several media outlets, including Newsday and The Buffalo News, reported Mihalich&#39;s hiring Tuesday night.</p>
<p>
	Mihalich replaces Mo Cassara, who was fired March 22 following a 7-25 season. Four Pride players were arrested in November on burglary charges stemming from dormitory room break-ins.</p>
<p>
	Hofstra lands an established coach and respected recruiter in Mihalich, who played a big role in reviving the Purple Eagles&#39; proud basketball tradition. He finished his tenure at Niagara with a 265-203 record and five postseason berths, including two NCAA tournament appearances in 2005 and &#39;07.</p>
<p>
	Before Mihalich, the Purple Eagles had reached the NCAA tournament only once, in 1970, when the team was led by Calvin Murphy and coached by Frank Layden.</p>
<p>
	Niagara also earned three NIT berths, including this year, when the Purple Eagles (19-14) won their third Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference regular-season championship under Mihalich.</p>
<p>
	He&#39;s a three-time MAAC coach of the year, and won 20 or more games four times while experiencing only three losing seasons at Niagara.</p>
<p>
	Last week, he was selected the Skip Prosser Man of the Year, which has been award annually since 2008 to honor the nation&#39;s Division I men&#39;s basketball coach who exhibits strong moral character.</p>
<p>
	At Hofstra, he takes over a Colonial Athletic Association program that has stumbled on and off the court over the past two seasons. The Pride have gone 17-47 in their past two years after a 21-12 finish in Cassara&#39;s first season in 2010-11.</p>
<p>
	Hofstra hasn&#39;t reached the NCAA tournament since consecutive appearances in 2000 and &#39;01. The Pride also earned three consecutive NIT berths from 2005-07.</p>
<p>
	The Pride&#39;s season didn&#39;t get off to a good start last year after Taran Buie and Jamal Coombs-McDaniel were suspended by Cassara for two preseason events and two regular-season games for violating team rules.</p>
<p>
	In late November, sophomore Shaquille Stokes and freshmen Kentrell Washington, Jimmy Hall and Dallas Anglin were charged in six burglaries that occurred Oct. 4-5.</p>

<p>
	The historical significance was not lost on Auriemma.</p>
<p>
	&quot;The fact I tied Pat Summitt&#39;s record - that puts you in a category with the greatest women&#39;s basketball coach who ever lived,&quot; Auriemma said.</p>
<p>
	Summitt, who retired after last season, is the all-time winningest coach in NCAA basketball -- men&#39;s or women&#39;s and won her eighth title in 2008.</p>
<p>
	&quot;The only person I would compare myself to is Pat Summitt &hellip; and to be there in that spot with her means a lot to me,&quot; Auriemma said.</p>
<p>
	In 28 seasons as UConn&#39;s head coach, Auriemma has posted a 91-17 record in NCAA Tournament play, and been in serious contention to win national titles every year since winning his first one in 1995.</p>
<p>
	&quot;I&#39;m really, really proud of that,&quot; Auriemma said. &quot;Because I know how hard it was to do it. And with each year that goes by and teams get knocked out and teams that everybody thinks are national championship teams or programs that should be in the Final Four and are not, with each year that that happens, I feel even better about what we&#39;ve done. Because I know more than anybody else, and so does my staff, just how incredibly difficult it is to do what we&#39;ve done.&quot;</p>
<p>
	Auriemma holds the record for most consecutive Women&#39;s Final Four appearances with six and has the best NCAA winning percentage of any coach in history (.842).</p>
<p>
	But even Auriemma never dreamt his program could win eight championships.</p>
<p>
	&quot;When we started and got to our first Final Four - here in New Orleans - we almost acted like we didn&#39;t belong,&quot; Auriemma said. &quot;The other three teams were Stanford, Virginia and Tennessee. When we didn&#39;t win, we thought, &#39;what if we never go back? What if we&#39;re one and done?&#39; There are other teams that have made it to the Final Four and never been back.</p>
<p>
	&quot;Then, when we won our first national championship in 1995, I thought lots of people have won one. What if we don&#39;t ever win again? I&#39;m always looking into the future and thinking, &#39;is this it? Are we going to be one of those programs? To back now and see how far we&#39;ve come in the last 18 years, never in our wildest dreams did we think it was possible.&quot;</p>
<p>
	This season, with three losses to Notre Dame and another to Baylor, the Huskies were having a &quot;sub-par&quot; season for the program. After UConn lost against the Irish in the Big East Championship Game, he sat with the team in the locker room and told them he was going to show them how to win a national championship. And, he did.</p>
<p>
	&quot;Sure enough, we&#39;re sitting right here,&quot; senior guard Kelly Faris said. &quot;There are times I don&#39;t know how he does what he does but he&#39;s pretty darn good at his good and figures out a way to get it done. I&#39;m happy to have him on my side.&quot;</p>
<p>
	Incredibly, the Huskies are 8-0 in NCAA title games -- a feat no other program had accomplished.</p>
<p>
	&quot;Eight for eight?&quot; Auriemma said. &quot;Man, oh, man &hellip; I&#39;ve been in the Final Four a couple times when we&#39;ve lost where mentally we weren&#39;t right. But we&#39;ve never been in a championship game where mentally we weren&#39;t right. All eight times that we&#39;ve won a national championship, I felt like my team was mentally ready to win a championship. And I think that&#39;s something that I&#39;m really proud of; that we don&#39;t show up in championship games not ready to play mentally or physically.&quot;</p>
<p>
	<strong>Taking notes</strong></p>
<p>
	<strong>&bull; </strong>The 33-point margin of victory was the largest in a championship game, obliterating the previous mark of 23 points by Tennessee&rsquo;s 1987 championship squad against Louisiana Tech (67-44.)</p>
<p>
	&bull; UConn&rsquo;s win against Louisville marks just the second time that a team has defeated two teams from its conference in the Final Four to claim the national title (Maryland, 2006.)</p>
<p>
	&bull; Breanna Stewart became just the fourth freshman and first since 1987 to be named Most Outstanding Player of the Women&rsquo;s Final Four. The other three were Cheryl Miller (USC, 1983); Clarissa Davis (Texas, 1986); and Tonya Edwards (Tennessee, 1987). Stewart becomes the first freshman since Maryland&rsquo;s Kristi Toliver in 2006, to be made to the Women&rsquo;s Final Four all-tournament team.</p>]]></description>

<p>
	Louisville&rsquo;s deadly 3-point threat had gotten them through some fierce, improbable matchups during the NCAA tournament, including defeats of No. 1 seed Baylor and No. 2 seeds Tennessee and California. Prior to the title game, the team had averaged nearly 50-percent from beyond the arc in the tournament.</p>
<p>
	Against Connecticut though, it was quite a different story. The Cards couldn&rsquo;t connect from 3-point range, going 5-for-23 to finish at 22-percent in the loss. Compare that to the Huskies&rsquo; 53-percent field-goal shooting and 50-percent from behind the arc, and Louisville had no shot -- literally.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;They just made big shot after big shot,&rdquo; Louisville head coach Jeff Walz said. &ldquo;Starting the second half, we come out, we score. Then Faris hits a 3. We come back down the floor and score again. Faris hits another 3. &hellip; Unfortunately we were never able to get it to where a shot actually started to matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	There&rsquo;s no question that it was an amazing run for the Cardinals, the most thrilling of this year&rsquo;s tournament. Not many teams could&rsquo;ve paved the way through the bracket that Louisville did, perhaps not even UConn.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I&rsquo;m proud of every single one of our players,&rdquo; Walz said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s without a doubt going to go down as one of the greatest runs in women&rsquo;s basketball.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	And the good news is, Walz is bringing back all of his starters and the majority of his bench, along with a group that has a national championship game under their belts. Not to mention the hopeful return of Asia Taylor, Tia Gibbs and Shawnta&rsquo; Dyer, all of which were injured this season.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Everybody&rsquo;s coming back, and so that&rsquo;s bad for everybody else because we did make this run at the end of the tournament, and it&rsquo;s just going to continue into next season and we&rsquo;re just going to get better and grow as a team and learn from this and hopefully be back next year,&rdquo; junior guard Shoni Schimmel said.</p>
<p>
	It&rsquo;d be easy to pat his team on the back and tell his players they should be proud of making it this far, of being the first No. 5 seed to be playing in the title game. But Jeff Walz doesn&rsquo;t want his team to be satisfied with just making it this far. There&rsquo;s some unfinished business at hand, and he wants them to feel the hunger to get back here next season and then take it one step further.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;We&rsquo;re honored to have the opportunity to play for the national championship, but we&rsquo;re not satisfied with the results,&rdquo; Walz said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to continue to get back to work and hopefully be able to be the ones that are out there celebrating.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	<strong>Taking Notes</strong></p>
<p>
	&bull; Louisville ends its season at 29-9 overall, reaching the national title game for the second time in school history.<br />
	&bull; The 29 wins is the second-most in school history, behind the 35 victories posted during the 2008-09 campaign.<br />
	&bull; Louisville is the lowest seed in history to reach the championship game.<br />
	&bull; Senior forward Monique Reid played in her 141st career game and is Louisville&rsquo;s all-time leader in games played.<br />
	&bull; The 33-point loss was Louisville&rsquo;s largest loss of the season.<br />
	&bull; UConn&rsquo;s 13 3-pointers made were the most given up by the Cardinals this season.<br />

<div>
	<p>
		<strong>CLEVELAND, Miss. -- </strong>Back-to-back RBI doubles by Tyler Cameron and Jackson McCurdy in the top of the eighth inning broke a 4-4 tie and helped propel No. 25 Southern Arkansas past No. 1 Delta State 6-5 on Tuesday evening at Ferriss Field.</p>
</div>
<p>
	The Muleriders (29-12) grabbed an early 1-0 lead in the top of the second inning when William Townsend singled to right field to score Cameron. That lead did not stand for long, however, as the Statesmen (27-5-1) scored an unearned run in the bottom of the frame to knot the game at one.</p>
<p>
	An inning later, the Statesmen took the lead on a RBI single to right field by Sam Kidd. On the next pitch, SAU starter Timothy Buchanan induced an inning-ending double play. Prior to that twin killing, the Muleriders&#39; defense had turned a double play in each of the first two innings.</p>
<p>
	In the next half inning, the Muleriders regained the lead as they scored a pair of runs on a two-RBI single off the bat of Jason Dahl. The go-ahead hit by Dahl scored Ryan Dardenne and Tyler Cameron, who both walked on four consecutive pitches to lead off the inning.</p>
<p>
	After holding the Statesmen off the board in the fourth, the Muleriders extended their lead out to two-runs as Chris Quinn led off the fifth inning with a solo homerun out to left field. The Statesmen answered back with a leadoff homer of their own in the sixth inning when Michael Vinson homered to right field to cut the Mulerider lead to 4-3.</p>
<p>
	The Vinson homerun chased Buchanan from the start, prompting James Baune to come on for his first relief appearance of the year. After allowing a one-out single, Baune induced the Statesmen into their fourth double play of the game as he got out of the inning with the lead intact.</p>
<p>
	An inning later, however, the Statesmen scored an unearned run off of Baune to knot the game up at four.</p>
<p>
	In the Muleriders&#39; next at-bats in the eighth, Dardenne led off with a well-placed a single into left-centerfield. On the next pitch, Cameron chased Dardenne home as he laced the ball past the drawn-in third baseman for a run-scoring double. In the next at-bat, McCurdy traded places with Cameron as he shot the ball the other way down the right field line.</p>
<p>
	Now leading by a pair of runs, the Muleriders turned to the bullpen once more. This time, Blake Sullivan was called upon to protect the lead and the freshman left-hander did just that by using five pitches to toss a perfect bottom of the eighth inning.</p>
<p>
	The Muleriders were unable to build on their lead in the top of the ninth inning, but in the bottom of the frame, the ball was turned over to Justin Thomas to close it out. Thomas, who was looking to tie his own single-season saves record, got into a deep jam as the first two batters reached base.</p>
<p>
	A sacrifice bunt in the next at-bat gave Thomas an out, but it also moved the base runners up 90-feet, and put the tying run in scoring position at second base. A batter later, the Statesmen pulled to within a run as Thomas got Kidd to groundout to David Harris at shortstop for the second out of the inning. Two pitches later, Thomas nailed down his record-tying 11th save of the season as he got Tyler Aldridge to groundout to Brady Capshaw at third base.</p>]]></description>

</div>
<p>
	<strong>CORVALLIS, Ore. -- </strong>Aaron Payne had a two-RBI triple in the top of the ninth inning to break a 3-3 tie and lead No. 9 Oregon to a 6-3 win against No. 7 Oregon State in a non-conference game on Tuesday at Goss Stadium.</p>
<p>
	Payne pulled a 1-2 pitch into the right field corner scoring J.J. Altobelli from second and Brett Thomas from first to give the Ducks a 5-3 lead. Ryon Healy added a sacrifice fly to score Payne to give Oregon (24-8) a three-run lead.</p>
<p>
	Jimmie Sherfy got Oregon State (25-6) in order in the ninth striking out the first two batters he faced before ending the game on a fly ball to right field. Sherfy picked up his ninth save of the season.</p>
<p>
	Freshman Garrett Cleavinger picked up his first career-win pitching a scoreless eighth inning. Four Ducks&rsquo; relievers combined to hold OSU scoreless over the final five innings of the game. Darrell Hunter entered the game with the score tied to begin the fifth and threw two scoreless innings. Christian Jones struck out two Beavers in scoreless seventh inning.</p>
<p>
	Payne went 2-for-3 with two RBI and two walks to lead the Ducks&rsquo; offense. Tyler Baumgartner was 2-for-4 with a RBI.</p>
<p>
	Oregon State took a 1-0 lead in the bottom of the first when Oregon starter Jordan Spencer walked Jake Rodriguez with the bases loaded.</p>
<p>
	Oregon answered with two runs in the second without the benefit of a hit. The Ducks took advantage of two hit by pitches and four wild pitches by starter Taylor Starr to get the runs. Connor Hofmann picked up a RBI to score the first run a fielder&rsquo;s choice sacrifice bunt scoring Scott Heineman. Josh Graham scored the second run on a wild pitch. Both Heineman and Graham reached base by being hit by pitches.</p>
<p>
	Baumgartner pushed the lead to 3-1 in the third with a RBI single over the shortstop&rsquo;s head to score Mitchell Tolman from second.</p>
<p>
	The Beavers tied it with two runs in the bottom of the fourth. Jared Casper drove in the first run with a RBI single to centerfield and advanced to second on an error by Hofmann. Casper scored the tying run on a Ryan Barnes sacrifice bunt.</p>
<p>
	Oregon returns to Pac-12 Conference play this weekend when they play a three-game series at Cal on Friday.</p>]]></description>
