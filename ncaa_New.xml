<p>
	<strong>MIAMI SHORES, Fla.</strong> -- Second-ranked Barry locked up the No. 1 seed at next week&#39;s Sunshine State Conference Championships, following Wednesday&#39;s 8-1 win against No. 8 Lynn.</p>
<p>
	The Buccaneers (21-0, 8-0 SSC) completed a perfect regular season in conference with their victory against the Fighting Knights.</p>
<p>
	&quot;It&#39;s always a tough match when we play Lynn,&quot; Barry head coach Avi Kigel said. &quot;They&#39;re always one of the best teams in the country.&quot;</p>
<p>
	It started with nifty doubles play as Barry was at its best. The Buccaneers No. 1 doubles team of Elisabeth Abanda and Emma Onila, ranked No. 11 in NCAA Division II, knocked off third-ranked Valentine Confonfalonieri and Ioana Ivan 8-5 in the final pairs match to be completed. That gave Barry a 3-0 lead.</p>
<p>
	&quot;Lynn&#39;s No. 1 doubles is ranked No. 3 in the country for a reason,&quot; Kigel said. &quot;We knew they were a very strong team. But we also knew that our No. 1 doubles team is very strong, and if we play the way we are capable of playing that we would have a good chance to win. It was close, but we were able to get the &#39;W&#39; at the end.&quot;</p>
<p>
	Barry&#39;s No. 2 tandem of Linda Fritschken and Kimmy Twelker rolled to an 8-2 win against Ana Kriz and Aleks Vukadinovic for the Buccaneers&#39; first point. Isabela Miro and Karina Goia upped the Bucs&#39; lead to 2-0 with an 8-3 victory against Kim Przeszlowski and Alina Jane at the third flight.</p>
<p>
	&quot;We got off to a really good start, being up 3-0 after doubles,&quot; Kigel said, &quot;And we just kept our momentum going in singles.&quot;</p>
<p>
	Twelker picked up a win versus Kriz, who retired with the Buccaneers&#39; freshman leading 3-0 in the first set. That extended Barry&#39;s lead to 4-0. Ranked 33rd in the country, Fritschken sealed the team victory with a 6-1, 6-1 against Przeszlowski at No. 3 singles.</p>
<p>
	Leading 1-0 in the second set, Fritschken mixed backhand with cross-court shots to chase the aggressive and athletic Przeszlowski around the court to take the next two games. Przeszlowski remained aggressive and ran down ball after ball, eventually winning a game. But with Fritschken leading 4-1 in the second set, she was able to close the match by taking the final two games.</p>
<p>
	&quot;She was playing very smart, moving her side to side,&quot; Barry assistant coach Ana Maria Zuleta said. &quot;She was wearing her out. As the match wore on, Linda [Fritschken] increased the pace to finish the point faster. By increasing the pace, she got easier shots to go for winners to close up the match. Linda has the game to speed up and place shots.</p>
<p>
	&quot;Her opponent was really good. She was defensive. Linda got a little bit more tired with those long rallies. But she played really smart, strong and aggressive.&quot;</p>
<p>
	Akemi Maehama posted a 6-1, 6-3 victory against Vukadinovic at No. 6. Goia that gave the Bucs their fourth singles win when she beat Jane 6-3, 6-2 at No. 4.</p>
<p>
	Following Onila&#39;s 6-1, 6-1 loss to the 13th-ranked Ivan at No. 2, Abanda put a bow on the Bucs&#39; victory with a signature win at the top flight. Ranked 28th in the country, Abanda beat the fourth-ranked Confalonieri 6-4, 6-3 at No. 1.</p>
<p>
	&quot;She just played a very solid match,&quot; Kigel said of Abanda, who has beaten the top two-ranked singles players in the South Region in this, her first, NCAA season. &quot;She was aggressive with all of her shots. She kept pressuring Valentine the whole time, without any letdowns.</p>
<p>
	&quot;We always knew that Bess could play at that level, and even better. She&#39;s had a little bit of ups and downs in the last four or five matches, but [Wednesday] she had a very solid performance. We knew that she is capable of playing at this level, which she needed to beat a really good player like Valentine. Elisabeth [Abanda] just needs to stay aggressive because that&#39;s her game.&quot;</p>]]></description>

<p>
	<strong>CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. </strong>-- Radford recorded one of its most notable victories in program history Wednesday with a narrow 9-8 upset of No. 5 Virginia at Davenport Field. The Highlanders defeated a top-10 team for the second time in their history.</p>
<p>
	The eight-game win streak for the Highlanders tied a school record set in 1989.</p>
<p>
	Radford (20-11) struck for three runs in the top of the first inning. Josh Gardiner led off the game with a walk followed by a Josh Reavis single. Jeff Kemp reached on an error, and Zach Woolcock plated the first run on a groundout. Alexander Lee singled home a pair of runs, and RU took a lead it did not surrender.</p>
<p>
	After the Cavaliers scored a run in the bottom half of the first, the Highlanders exploded for six runs on six hits in the second. The highlight was a Kemp three-run homer to left field. Reavis also knocked in a run with a single, and Hunter Higgerson delivered a two-run double to give the Highlanders a 9-1 lead.</p>
<p>
	Virginia (30-4) tallied a run in the fourth on a solo homer by Mike Papi, and added two more on a two-run homer in the sixth by Derek Fisher.</p>
<p>
	Dylan Nelson (4-2) lasted six innings and allowed four runs on four hits to earn the victory. Jeff Maxwell worked two innings of scoreless relief, and the Highlanders took a 9-4 lead into the bottom of the ninth.</p>
<p>
	After Daniel Bridgeman started the inning on the mound and was unable to get an out before the Cavaliers loaded the bases, closer Michael Costello came on to earn the save, but it wasn&#39;t without some tense moments for Radford fans.</p>
<p>
	The Cavaliers rallied for four runs, but Costello got clean-up hitter Brandon Downes to pop up with runners at first and second to end the game. The save was Costello&#39;s seventh of the season.</p>]]></description>

	<p>
		<strong>BATON ROUGE, La. --</strong> For the first time since 2005, Mississippi State (16-7, 6-5 SEC) has downed three consecutive top-20 opponents, as the Bulldogs defeated No. 20 LSU (13-10, 4-7 SEC) 4-1 on Wednesday. With the win, State has won its last four matches against the Tigers, including a 7-0 victory earlier this season.</p>
</div>
<p>
	The win continues what has been an impressive road showing for State this spring, improving to 6-0 in away matches.</p>
<p>
	State took the early lead Wednesday by grabbing the doubles point. On court three, the two teams traded holds until the MSU duo of Pedro Dumont and Ethan Wilkinson earned a break to go up 6-5, eventually defeating LSU&rsquo;s Boris Arias and Tam Trinh 8-6.</p>
<p>
	The State tandem of Jordan Angus and Malte Stropp, ranked 12th in the nation, went up a break to start and then earned another break later in the match to go up 6-3. The Tigers&rsquo; No. 52 team of Chris Simpson and Stefan Szacinski earned a break and then a hold to come within one, but Angus and Stropp held strong to take the match 8-6, clinching the doubles point for State. Play on court two was suspended at that point, with LSU&rsquo;s Roger Anderson and Olivier Borsos leading MSU&rsquo;s Romain Bogaerts and Zach White 7-6.</p>
<p>
	In singles, tiebreakers were the determinant for the first set on four courts. After the teams had traded first sets on courts two and five, the Bulldogs claimed three of the breakers (two by 8-6 scores), capturing four of the six first sets in the process.  </p>
<p>
	White was the most dominant point of the day, only dropping two games en route to defeating LSU&rsquo;s Arias 6-2, 6-0 on court five for a 2-0 MSU lead. On court six, Dumont battled to take the first-set tiebreaker 7-6(4) and then cruised to victory in the second set, downing the Tigers&rsquo; Harrison Kennedy 7-6(4), 6-1, pushing MSU&#39;s lead to 3-0.   </p>
<p>
	LSU&rsquo;s lone point of the day came on court two, as No. 104 Szacinski upended MSU&rsquo;s No. 58 Stropp 6-3, 6-4.</p>
<p>
	The Bulldogs then clinched the match thanks to senior James Chaudry who, after taking a first-set tiebreaker 7-6(6), found his groove in the second, blasting LSU&rsquo;s Borsos to win 7-6(6), 6-0 and hand the Bulldogs the win.</p>
<p>
	Play on courts one and four were suspended once the match was clinched, with MSU freshman No. 12 Bogaerts leading 7-6(6), 2-3 against LSU&rsquo;s No. 51 Simpson at the top spot and LSU&rsquo;s Mark Bowtell leading MSU&rsquo;s Angus 7-6(1), 1-3 at No. 4.  </p>]]></description>

	<p>
		<strong>GETTYSBURG, Pa. --</strong> No. 2 Dickinson jumped out to a big lead on Gettysburg and held off a late rally by the Bullets to remain unbeaten on the season with a 12-10 victory at the Battlefield.</p>
</div>
<p>
	The Bullets struck first, taking a 1-0 lead at the 9:46 mark on a goal by Martin Manilla. The Red Devils capitalized on a couple of Gettysburg penalties to answer with five consecutive goals to take a 5-1 lead at the end of the first quarter.</p>
<p>
	Junior Parker Waldron put the Devils on the board at the 7:44 mark to pull Dickinson even. Classmate Brian Gleason tallied back-to-back goals, finishing an assist from Brian Cannon and scoring a transition goal with an assist from long pole midfielder Brandon Palladino.</p>
<p>
	Nick Leon stretched the margin to 4-1 with an extra-man goal, scoring with just 28 seconds on the clock. The Devils won the ensuing face-off and Cannon scored with 11 seconds to play in the quarter.</p>
<p>
	Brett Parker scored off an assist from Will Scott, and Carter Moore won the face-off and scored just six seconds later to give Dickinson an 7-1 advantage with 12:40 to play in the half.</p>
<p>
	Cannon tallied another to put the Devils up 8-1 before a three-goal run by the Bullets cut the deficit to 8-4 at halftime.</p>
<p>
	The teams played scoreless through most of the third quarter before the Devils tallied a pair behind goals from Gleason and senior Matt Cherry, scoring in a span of just 27 seconds.</p>
<p>
	Palladino added another assist to Gleason and was looking for another off a face-off, following a Gettysburg goal with 1:29 remaining in the period to make the score 10-5 heading into the final quarter.</p>
<p>
	Leon opened the fourth with a goal from Leon as he finished an assist from first-year Chris Menard at the 13:58 mark. The Bullets countered at the 11:46 mark, capitalizing on a fast break.</p>
<p>
	Palladino had an opportunity to score with less than six minutes to play, dodging into the space on a clear save by Jon Maddalone, who turned the shot away.</p>
<p>
	Jimmy Morris tallied for Gettysburg to cut the margin to 11-7 with 4:30 remaining. The Red Devils were also flagged with a one-minute tripping penalty, giving the Bullets a man-up opportunity following the goal.</p>
<p>
	A turnover led to another Gettysburg goal, cutting the lead to 11-8, with 3:45 to play in regulation. The Devils spread the defense and Cherry found a lane to add some insurance with an unassisted tally at the 2:45 mark.</p>
<p>
	Maddox kept the Bullets in it, answering just 21 seconds later to make the score 12-9. Jameson Smith cut the deficit to just a pair, scoring on a feed with 1:41 on the clock.</p>
<p>
	The Devils forced a turnover after Gettysburg won the face-off, drawing a slash penalty with 54 seconds to play to earn a man-up advantage for remainder of regulation. The Bullets were able to gain possession, forcing a turnover with more than 30 seconds left, but the Red Devils held on for the 12-10 win.</p>
<p>
	Gleason recorded a hat trick with three goals on the day. Palladino caused four turnovers, controlled a pair of ground balls and handed out two assists with the long pole. Cannon added two goals and an assist while Cherry and Leon each found the net twice.</p>
<p>
	Senior goaltender Greg Hanley made 10 saves and picked up three ground balls. Moore won 12 face-offs, controlled four ground balls and scored his first goal of the season.</p>]]></description>

<p>
	<strong>HARTFORD, Conn.</strong> -- Midfielder Martha Griffin scored a game-high five goals to lead Trinity (Conn.) to a 19-5 victory against visiting Springfield at Sheppard Field. Reigning NCAA champion Trinity, ranked No. 1 in the nation, tied a program-record 18 wins in a row set in 2011, while improving to 10-0. Springfield fell to 7-6.</p>
<p>
	Trinity controlled play from the beginning, opening up a 6-0 led after 19:22 of play. Bantam senior attacker Hadley Duncan scored the game&#39;s first goal from senior attacker Haley Thompson 1:53 after the opening draw, and senior midfielder Megan Leonhard tallied three goals to highlight a 6-0 Trinity run to started the game.</p>
<p>
	Freshman midfielder Connie Nielson ended the Springfield scoring drought with back-to-back scores at 15:45 and 13:02 of the first half, respectively. Sophomore midfielder Michelle Dorsey scored the third consecutive Pride goal 28 seconds later to make the score 6-3.</p>
<p>
	The Bantams closed the first half with a 5-0 run that included consecutive goals by Griffin in the final three minutes before the break. After a goal by Dorsey from Nielson 30 second after halftime, junior attacker Shea Kusiak scored on a free position for the Bantams to ignite a 5-0 run that put the game out of reach. Attacker Molly Cox scored twice during the spurt.</p>
<p>
	Trinity sophomore midfielder Lindsay Mullaney was the fifth of five Bantam multiple-goal scorers with two, while Thompson and junior attacker Kathleen Timmons dished two assists apiece, and Leonhard had a game-high four draw controls and forced three turnovers. The Bantam defense of senior Mallory Hinman, senior Hillary McNamara, and juniors Midge Daniel and Lyndsey Shepard held Springfield to just eight shots and caused 11 turnovers, as Emily Mooney and senior Olivia Whitney did not make a save in 60 minutes in the Bantam goal. Junior backstop Anne Versprille had 11 stops for Springfield.</p>]]></description>

    <title><![CDATA[What they're facing]]></title>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>
	<strong>CANTON, Mich. --</strong> This will not be easy.</p>
<p>
	Coaches -- and thereby competitors, were given a look Wednesday at the lane graph for the national championship tournament, which will get under way Thursday morning at Super Bowl Lanes.</p>
<p>
	Think of the lane graph like a course book in golf. It gives the competitors a look at the hazards they&#39;ll face. Unlike golf however, those hazards aren&#39;t visible to the naked eye.</p>
<p>
	The lanes are dressed with oil -- sometimes called lane conditioner. When the ball hits the oil, it acts like a car tire trying to gain traction on ice. The more oil the ball comes in contact with, the more the ball will skid, or go straight. When the ball hits a dry area, it creates friction and the ball will hook -- or curve -- in the same direction as the rotation of the ball (usually left to right for lefties and from right to left for righties).</p>
<p>
	Ideally, competitors are looking for heavier oil in the front part of the lane and less in the back so the ball will save its energy to the end of the shot, therefore hitting the pins harder when it reaches them.</p>
<p>
	The oil pattern this week is 42 feet long -- that&#39;s a few feet longer than your normal &quot;house shot&quot; pattern -- with heavy oil across the lane in the first 10 feet and oil across the lane with the exception of just the first board on each side of the lane. There is more oil in the center of the lane, which give the players a bit of forgivness, but it&#39;s nowhere near the ratio of a common house condition.</p>
<p>
	In short, the players will have to be accurate and will have to be able to repeat shots -- under pressure -- in order to be successful.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>
	When you take a look at the list of teams vying for the 2013 NC Bowling Championship beginning Thursday at Super Bowl Lanes in Canton, Mich., two-time defending national champion Maryland-Eastern Shore is sure to grab your attention.</p>
<p>
	And it should. After all, the Hawks are two-time defending national champions and have won 10 tournaments this season. What&#39;s more, they haven&#39;t finished worse than second in any event they&#39;ve competed in this year.</p>
<p>
	&quot;We are honored to be the second overall selection,&quot; head coach Kristina Frahm said. &quot;I do feel, however that we have a top team and I think our experiences can help us make a serious run at winning another national championship.</p>

</table></p>
<p>
	&quot;Obviously, we are looking for a three-peat.&quot;</p>
<p>
	Look a bit further at the team list and you&#39;ll notice that the field includes every school that has won the national championship since its inception in 2004.</p>
<p>
	Current NTCA No. 1 Nebraska won the first two championships in 2004 and &#39;05 and the Huskers hoisted the hardware again in 2009. The Huskers, like the Hawks, have participated in every national championship tournament. This season&#39;s Huskers, however, sport a bit of a different look than in years past. The team boasts just one senior, team leader Kristina Mickelson, who suffered a cracked elbow in a car accident in September and has seen limited action this season.</p>
<p>
	&quot;She&#39;s pretty gritty,&quot; head coach Bill Straub said. &quot;She&#39;s been wearing herself out with applications of Icy-Hot. She&#39;s had a restrictor on her elbow to kind of keep things tight so it&#39;s not too troublesome for her, but she just grits her teeth and plays along.</p>
<p>
	&quot;It&#39;s been a tough year for her, but not through lack of effort.&quot;</p>
<p>
	Mickelson&#39;s roommate, sophomore Liz Kuhlkin, has been more than a pleasant surprise this season, Straub said. She&#39;s earned spots on four different All-Tournament teams this season.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	&quot;Surprised might be too strong, but certainly well-pleased,&quot; Straub said of Kulikin. &quot;She&#39;s worked her tail off to try to help us out as best she can and she&#39;s just continuing to develop as a player and she&#39;s turned into quite an excellent one.&quot;</p>
<p>
	Central Missouri is ranked No. 2 in the country and enters the tournament as the No. 1 seed after snagging three tournament titles. The Jennies are led by senior Natalie Jimenez, who has averaged 209.60 this season while garnering a pair of Most Outstanding Player honors, including one at the McKendree Duals where she averaged more than 239.</p>
<p>
	Vanderbilt lost to UMES in the championship game in 2011. Last year in Cleveland, the Commodores lost to Fairleigh Dickinson in the last semifinal match. This year, Vandy will make its eighth trip to the championship tournament.</p>
<p>
	Head coach John Williamson says while it may seem differently, his team&#39;s consistency has not come easily.</p>
<p>
	&quot;Because we have had a nice run of success, it might be tempting for some fans to think this is easily attained but anyone closely following the regular season can attest that there are more quality teams than ever before and some very good teams were not chosen.&quot;</p>
<p>
	Just as Nebraska, the Commodores come to the championship with just one senior starter --&nbsp; Jessica Earnest, a three-time All-American who averaged 207 in team games and 212 in Baker contests.</p>
<p>
	Expect Vanderbilt to rely heavily on its underclassmen, including freshman Robyn Renslow, who often bowled in the anchor spot thanks to her 208.5 average Another freshman, lefty Amanda Fry, averaged 210 was the Most Outstanding Player at the Sam Houston State Track Kat Klash.</p>
<p>
	Fairleigh Dickinson, which lost to UMES in last year&#39;s final and won titles in 2006 and &#39;10, is back again as the eighth and final seed.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I am so proud of this team,&rdquo; head coach Mike LoPresti said. &ldquo;Now we have a new life and a second season. We went through a lot of transitions this year with a combination of a few veterans and a lot of new players. We&#39;re so happy to extend the season because we have made so many improvements, and now we get to put it all together on the nation&#39;s biggest stage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	One of those key veterans for the Knights is senior Danielle McEwen, last year&#39;s NTCA Division I Bowler of the Year. McEwen appears poised for more honors in Detroit. She averages 216.52 with a strike percentage of 54.65. In January, earned the individual championship at the USBC Team USA Trials for the second consecutive year. As a result, McEwan will be the sole US representative at the QubicaAMF World Cup and will be a member of Team USA during the calendar year.</p>
<p>
	For right now, however, McEwen is focused on enjoying this week.</p>
<p>
	&quot;It&#39;s not enough for me just to make it, especially in my senior year,&quot; she said. I want to ... go into nationals with a different mindset and hopefully come out with a better outcome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	As for those defending champion Hawks, they are led by Colombian left-hander Anggie Ramirez. Recently named a finalist for the International Bowling Media Association College Bowler of the Year, Ramirez averaged nearly 213 during the regular season and earned MEAC Bowler of the Year, All-MEAC First-Team, MEAC Championship MVP and MEAC All-Tournament Team awards. She was also named the conference&#39;s Bowler of the Week six times.</p>
<p>
	&quot;It was always my dream since I was MEAC Rookie of the Year to be MEAC Player of the Year. Now that I won this and MVP of the tournament, I am so happy that my dream could come true,&quot; Ramirez said.</p>
<p>
	Competition begins with qualifying rounds on Thursday, in which each team bowls one five-person regular team game against each of the other seven teams participating in the championship for a total of seven games.</p>
<p>
	Bracket play begins Friday morning, as teams will be seeded based on Thursday&rsquo;s record during team qualifying. Teams will then compete in best-of-seven-games Baker matches in a double-elimination tournament.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	In the Baker format, each of the five team members, in order, bowls a complete frame until a complete (10-frame) game is bowled.&nbsp; A Baker match tied 3&frac12; games to 3&frac12; games after seven games will be decided by a tiebreaker using the Modified Baker format.</p>]]></description>

<p>
	This year&rsquo;s list is comprised of 11 seniors, eight juniors, four sophomores and two freshmen. The student-athletes selected represent 17 NCAA DI universities and five athletic conferences. Alabama leads the way among universities with four athlete representatives, followed by Oklahoma and Tennessee with three apiece, Texas with two and Arizona State, Arkansas, California, Florida, Louisville, LSU, Michigan, Missouri, Notre Dame, Oregon, Penn State, South Florida and Washington each have one member.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>
	The USA Softball Collegiate Player of the Year award is voted on by coaching representatives from 11 DI Conferences in the 15 ASA Regions, as well as members of the media who consistently cover DI Softball across the country.</p>
